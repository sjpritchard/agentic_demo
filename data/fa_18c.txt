 INTRODUCTION
Thank you for your purchase of DCS: F/A-18C!
DCS: F/A-18C brings to Digital Combat Simulator an iconic aircraft of modern naval aviation . This module features
the most realistic PC simulation of the F /A-18C, which includes accurately simulated flight dynamics, avionics,
sensors, and weapon systems. This module simulates the F /A-18C as it existed in United States Navy and Marine
Corps service circa 200 5.
The F /A-18C is one of the most successful naval strike fighters in modern history; and has served as the backbone
of U.S. Navy carrier air wings for decades, as well as serving in the air  forces of several other  nations ranging
from Europe, to the Middle East, to the Pacific region.  Known for its dual-role design, mission versatility, and of
course its ability to operate from aircraft carriers at sea, the F/A -18C is also one of the most maneuverable aircraft
in close -range air -to-air combat  with a robust fly -by-wire control system and high angle -of-attack capabilities.
When used in conjunction with the DCS: Supercarrier  module, the DCS: F/A -18C gives DCS players the most
authentic U.S. Naval Aviation experience available for the PC, short of strapping on a G -suit yourself and tasting
the salty air first -hand.
Hook up, salute, and launch yourself into naval aviation!
Key features:
• Detailed, fully -clickable, 6DOF  cockpit along with a highly detailed external model.
• APG-73 Fire Control Radar (with air -to-air and air -to-ground modes), ATFLIR and L itening  II targeting pods,
and Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS).
• Air-to-air weapons include the M61 20mm Vulcan cannon, AIM -9 Sidewinder heat -seeking missiles, AIM -7
Sparrow semi -active radar -homing missiles , and AIM -120 AMRAAM active radar -homing missiles.
• A large assortment of air -to-ground munitions, including (but not  limited to) AGM -88 HARM anti -radar
missiles, AGM -65 IR - and laser -guided Maverick anti -armor missiles, AGM -84D Harpoon anti -ship missiles,
AGM-84E/H SLAM long -range attack missiles, AGM -62 Walleye TV -guided glide bombs, AGM -154 JSOW glide
bombs, JDAM iner tially aided munitions, and Paveway laser -guided bombs.
• DL16 datalink, providing a high degree of situational awareness and teamwork between wingmen.
• ALR-67(V) r adar warning  receiver, ALE -47 countermeasure dispensers, and ALQ -165 ECM jamming system.
• Comple te integration with DCS: Supercarrier module.
• Fly missions in the Black Sea  region or one of the many DLC maps like the Persian Gulf, Syria, and more.
• Multiplayer cooperative and head -to-head gameplay.

Author’s note:  The DCS F/A -18C Early Access Guide has been migrated to a new standardized format and
structure. As part of this update, several user -reported errors or confusing descriptions have been updated. In
addition, the appendix at the end of the manual that lists hostile radar symbols with their corresponding ALIC
codes and HARM classes has also been updated to reflect the current threat  radars  within DCS World.
As a whole, the F/A -18C Early Access Guide requires a larger revision to not only bring it up to date with the
current state of the DCS F/A -18C module, but to bring it up to the high standards that are expected of DCS
aircraft modules. It is my intention t o complete the F/A -18C manual with the same level of dedication and
attention to detail; however this process will take time  (as similar updates are being performed for the A -10C, A-
10C II, F -16C, and AH -64D manuals) , and I appreciate your patience.

 FLIGHT CONTROL
Primary aircraft flight controls include the  Control Stick, Throttle s, and Rudder Pedals. The stick is used to roll the
aircraft left and right to perform turns , and pitch the nose up and down to climb or descend. The throttle s are
used to control engine power and airspeed. The pedals are used in flight to yaw the a irplane left and right using
the rudder (like a boat) ; and on the ground to turn the nose wheel when taxiing.
If you are flying with only a keyboard, the primary flight control keys will be the arrow keys to control roll and
pitch, [Numpad+]  and [Numpad -] to control throttle, and [Z] / [X] to control the rudder pedals. If you do
have a joystick, it may be equipped with a throttle handle and/or a twist grip, which will allow you to control the
rudder pedals.

When flying from the cockpit, the Controls Indicator display  may be toggled  by pressing  [RCtrl] +[Enter]  to see
a visual reference of the positions of your flight controls.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  23

 Changing Airspeed
There are several methods to increase or decrease airspeed:
• Aircraft engine power.  When advancing the throttles, the engines will produce more thrust.
Likewise, retarding the throttles will produce less thrust.
• Aircraft pitch angle and pitch rate.  Generally, pitching the nose up above the horizon will cause
the aircraft to slow down; and pitching the nose down below the horizon will cause th e aircraft to speed
up. Rapid pitch changes can also affect speed, regardless of whether it is a pitch change in the
horizontal plane or in the vertical plane. Higher pitch rates increase the Angle -of-Attack (AoA), which
increases drag, leading to a loss i n airspeed.
• Speedbrake.  Opening the speedbrake will cause an increase in drag, which can cause a loss of speed,
or reduce the rate the airspeed increases while in a dive.
• Landing Gear.  Lowering the landing gear will produce additional drag like the speedbr ake, b ut they
should only be lowered when below 300 knots  to prevent damage .
The Airspeed & Velocity Scale on the HUD  can be used to monitor airspeed, along with the Airspeed/Mach
Indicator on the center section of the instrument panel.
Changing Altitude
Changing the pitch of the aircraft can increase or decrease the altitude.
• Increase altitude . Pitching the nose up above the horizon will increase altitude, but this will cause a
loss in airspeed unless engine power is increased to compensate. If the aircraft starts to stall, lower
the nose and/or increase engine power.
• Decrease altitude . Pitching  the nose down below the horizon will decrease altitude, but this will cause
an increase in airspeed unless engine power is reduced to compensate. Additionally, the speedbrakes
can be used to maintain current airspeed in shallow dives.
The Barometric Altit ude & Altitude Scale and Radar Altimeter on the HUD can be used to monitor altitude, along
with the Altimeter on the center portion of the instrument panel. Climb/descent rates can be monitored on the
HUD Vertical Velocity Scale, along with the Vertical Ve locity Indicator on the center instrument panel.
Changing Heading
Changing the heading of the aircraft in the horizontal plane is accomplished by rolling, or banking, the aircraft in
the desired direction. As the bank angle is increased, the stick must be pulled back in pitch to prevent a loss in
altitude. At steeper bank angles, pulling back on the stick can increase the turn rate by pitching the nose in the
direction of the turn. Just prior to reaching the desired heading, the stick should be used to roll  the aircraft back
to level flight, so that the aircraft wings return to level just as the desired heading is reached.
Note the following:
• Steep bank angles will require more pitch input to the stick to prevent altitude loss.
• During steep turns, higher pit ch rates will increase the turn rate but will also increase the wings’ angle -
of-attack and cause the aircraft to slow down. If you lose too much speed, the aircraft may become
uncontrollable. Increasing engine power or decreasing the turn rate will prevent  speed loss.  DCS [F/A-18C]

24

 • Keeping the Flight Path Marker on the Horizon Line throughout the turn will prevent altitude loss. A
combination of pitch and roll inputs using the stick can be used to maintain altitude throughout the
turn.
The Magnetic Heading Tape on the HU D can be used to monitor heading, which is displayed on either the top or
bottom of the HUD, depending on the selected master mode. The Steering Cue shows the relative direction to
your steerpoint. If you turn the aircraft to align the Flight Path Marker w ith the Steering Cue, you will be flying
to your steerpoint.
The Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI) also provides the aircraft’s heading. The top of the magnetic
heading compass that is aligned with the lubber line at the top of instrument is  the current heading.

 THE F/A -18C

 AIRCRAFT HISTORY
The McDonnell -Douglas F/A -18 was a groundbreaking aircraft from its very first flight. It holds the honors of
being of the US Navy’s first carrier -based true multirole fighter, the first aircraft with carbon -fiber wings, and the
first fighter aircraft with a fully digital fly -by-wire flight control system. What began as the “loser” of the US Air
Force’s LWF program evolved into a prolific fro nt-line fighter and attack aircraft that served the needs of the
United States and seven other countries for nearly forty years.
The VFAX Programs
In the early 1960s, the US Navy’s principal concern was
the fleet defense mission. The discovery of the Tu -26
“Backfire” by US intelligence caused worry among Navy
admirals that the Soviet Union would soon be capable of
attacking carrier fleets, launching sea -skimming cruise
missiles from well outside the defensible range of the
carrier.
In response to this new threat, the Navy began the VFAX
program, intended to develop a long -range, highly
maneuverable air superiority and fleet defense aircraft.
The program mirrored the US Air Force’s concurrent F -X
program, w hich ultimately resulted in the F -15 Eagle.
VFAX was intended to replace the Navy’s aging fleet of
fighter aircraft, especially the F -111Bs, which were seen
as very lacking in the fleet defense role.
Grumman Aerospace proposed combining its design
experie nce with the F -111B and the A -6 Intruder to produce
a new aircraft, named Design 303. The new aircraft would
be built around a pair of new technologies originally
developed for the F -111B: the powerful AN/AWG -9 radar
and the long -range AIM -54 Phoenix missi le.
The combination of the AWG -9 and AIM -54, placed in a
smaller, more agile airframe, was compelling enough to
convince the Navy to restructure the design requirements of
the VFAX program. The result was t he VFX program, which
ultimately produced the F -14 Tomcat, the Navy’s new
frontline fleet defense and air superiority fighter.
The F -14 enjoyed immediate success as a fleet defense
aircraft, but by the 1970s, it became apparent that it was too expensive an d maintenance -heavy to supplant all
existing Navy fighters. The Secretary of Defense, William H. Clements Jr., ordered the Navy to seek proposals for
a smaller, cheaper alternative to the F -14. Grumman responded with a proposal for the F -14X, a lightweight , less
expensive variant of the F -14. McDonnell -Douglas suggested navalizing the F -15. Both of those were rejected by
Clements.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  27

 At the time, the only two major proponents of the lightweight multirole fighter
concept were VAdm. Kent Lee, commander of Naval  Air Systems Command
(NAVAIR), and VAdm. William Houser, Deputy Chief Naval Officer. Though
Houser and Lee had very different ideas of what a multirole fighter would look
like, they were alone among the Navy brass in believing that the future of the
combat  aircraft was multirole capability.
Lee’s motivations stemmed partially from his experience at sea, where he
estimated that around fifty man -hours of maintenance effort  were being
expended for every one hour an aircraft spends in -flight. When Lee was
selected to serve as NAVAIR’s Commander, he began to advocate for a single
airframe that could replace F -4s, A-7s, and A -4s. Likewise, Houser had become
disillusioned with the existing Navy doctrine during his deployments, seeing
firsthand the difficulty in fly ing and maintaining numerous types of aircraft, each
with their own maintenance practices and parts requirements.
Now that the F -14 had been swept aside as a potential replacement for the
Navy’s fleet of fighter and strike aircraft,  Lee saw an opportunity to realize his
vision. After doggedly advocating his viewpoint to Clements, Clements went along with Lee’s recommendation,
and Lee was given the green light. The Navy then began another VFAX program under Lee’s stewardship, this
time with a greater emphasis on multirole capability.
Lee’s opinions were still unpopular with the other admirals, which made it difficult for Lee to secure Congressional
funding for the new project. Concurrent with the VFAX proposals, the US Air Force had also been looking for a
lightweight fighter (LWF) to complement its expensive F -15s. The House Armed Services Committee, looking to
reduce costs, ordered the Navy and Air Force to combine their efforts. Funding was diverted from VFAX into a
new program, ti tled Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF). NACF would be a new naval aircraft developed from the
contenders already participating in the Air Force’s LWF competition.
The YF -17 “Cobra”
Five defense companies submitted proposals for the LWF
competition, but only  two were selected to participate:
Northrop and General Dynamics. Northrop had already
developed its popular F -5E Tiger II into an internal
project titled N -300. The N -300 added distinctive
leading -edge root extensions (LERX) and more powerful
engines to t he F-5E, among other improvements. The N -
300 evolved into the P -530, which modified the design
of the LERXes, giving the P -530 much improved
maneuverability at high angles of attack. Northrop
selected the P -530 as its LWF contender, slightly
modifying it i nto the P -600. General Dynamics
meanwhile had produced the Model 401, later
designated the YF -16, and both companies were
awarded contracts of approximately $38 million to
develop their proposals into functional prototypes.
International and domestic interest in the LWF program
grew, and with it the stakes of the competition. In
response to the ballooning demand, the USAF merged the LWF program into the new Air Combat Fighter (ACF)
program. The ACF program  solidified the requirement that the LWF contenders be truly multirole aircraft.
VAdm Kent Lee (NHHC)
YF-16 and YF -17 (credit R.L. House)  DCS [F/A-18C]

28

 The YF -16 and YF -17 were tested by the US Air Force in a series of trial flights, and in 1975, the YF -16 was
selected to be the new USAF lightweight fighter. The YF -16 had sup erior acceleration, climb rates, endurance,
and turn rate. Its selection as the winner of the LWF competition secured it numerous procurement orders among
the USAF and NATO allies.
Because the NACF program ran simultaneously with the ACF program, both Gene ral Dynamics and Northrop had
also developed naval variants of their contenders. Neither firm had prior experience developing carrier aircraft.
General Dynamics paired with Vought to develop the Vought Model 1600, a proposal for a strengthened, carrier -
capable F -16; Northrop paired with McDonnell -Douglas to propose the F -18, a carrier -capable YF -17 variant.
Though the YF -16 had won the USAF competition, the Navy wasn’t happy with its single engine and narrow
landing gear. Thus, in 1975, The Navy announced i ts selection of the YF -17, which was to be transformed into a
carrier -based multirole combat aircraft.
Development of the F -18
McDonnell -Douglas and Northrop combined forces to develop the YF -17 into the F -18, then called Model 267.
Both companies agreed to split manufacturing responsibilities evenly: McDonnell -Douglas would build the forward
fuselage, wings, and stabilators; Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage components and the vertical
stabilizers. Final assembly would be at McDonnell -Dougl as.
The F -18 was largely similar in appearance to the YF -17 but underwent many structural and exterior changes to
meet the stringent requirements of a carrier -based aircraft. The entire aircraft was strengthened to withstand the
forces of carrier launch an d recovery, and the undercarriage and tailhook were enlarged and fortified. The wings
and stabilizers were enlarged, and the fuselage widened, and the extra size was used to boost the internal fuel
capacity by 4,460 pounds, sufficient to meet US Navy blue -water reserve requirements. A fully digital fly -by-wire
system with quadruple -redundant flight control computers was added, making the F -18 the first fighter aircraft
with such a control system. Accessories were added to support catapult launches. In all, the modifications brought
the gross weight of the F -18 to 37,000 pounds, a 10,000 -pound increase over the YF -17.
Originally, the F -18 was to be developed in three
variants: An F -18 fighter variant, an A -18 attack variant,
and a TF -18 trainer variant. The F-18 and A -18 variants
would later be combined when improvements in the
avionics and weapons capability of the aircraft allowed a
single variant to perform both roles effectively.
McDonnell -Douglas agr eed to be the prime contractor
for the naval F -18, with Northrop taking ownership of
the proposed land -based F -18L export variant. The F -
18L would never come to fruition, and Northrop and McDonnell -Douglas would end their partnership on bad
terms when expo rt variants of the F -18A drew sales away from the upcoming F -18L. Northrop would later sue
McDonnell -Douglas, claiming that the latter illegally used technologies developed by Northrop for the F -20
Tigershark, a lawsuit that ultimately ended in a settlemen t award of $50 million paid to Northrop. In exchange,
McDonnell -Douglas was free to sell the F -18, both internationally and domestically.
On September 13, 1978, the first production F -18 rolled off the assembly line. Unlike previous aircraft, which
underwe nt flight testing at their place of manufacture, the F -18 was flight -tested at the Naval Air Test Center at
Patuxent River, Maryland. Its first production flight occurred in November 1978, launching from Pax River, and
flown by a US Navy -trained test pilot  instead of a civilian employed by the manufacturer.

 F/A-18A and B Deployment
Following the completion of Navy flight testing, the F -18A
and B models began appearing at fleet replacement
squadrons (FRS) on both coasts. VMFA -314, based at
MCAS El Toro, bec ame the first squadron to receive the F -
18 in January 1983. On April 1, 1984, the Secretary of the
Navy announced that the new aircraft would be
designated the F/A -18, in recognition of its multirole
capability.
The F/A -18 spent a short amount of time grounded prior
to its first deployment, after fatigue cracks began
appearing on the vertical stabilizers. The cracks were
found to be due to the turbulent airflow from the LERXes
that passe d across the stabilizers. The stabilizers were
strengthened and the LERXes were redesigned. Years
later, small fences would be placed atop each LERX, to
divert tip vortices away from the stabilizers. These changes additionally gave the F/A-18 a small boost  in
controllability at high angles of attack.
The F/A-18 saw its first combat deployment between February and August of 1985, aboard the USS Constellation .
Naval aviators were pleased with its reliability in contrast to the F -14. In April 1986, F/A -18s saw  action for the
first time aboard the USS Coral Sea , on deployment off the coast of Libya for Operation Prairie Fire, with VFA -
131, VFA -132, VMFA -314, and VMFA -323 aboard.
The A and B model F/A-18 was also awarded the distinct privilege of being selected a s the eighth aircraft type to
be flown by the US Navy’s Blue Angels, replacing the A -4 Skyhawk in November 1986.
In total, more than 400 F/A -18A and B airframes were produced.
F/A-18C and D Deployment
In 1987, development of the F/A -18C began, commencing w ith Lot 10. The C and D models incorporated
numerous improvements, including upgraded avionics that added the ability for the F/A-18 to employ advanced,
modern weapons such as the AIM -120 AMRAAM, AGM -65 Maverick, and AGM -84 Harpoon. Lot 10 also added the
airborne self -protection jammer (ASPJ) and a ground -mapping synthetic aperture radar.
As with the A and B models, the F/A -18C was the single -seat variant, the D having two seats. The D model could
be configured either as a training variant or as an all -weather strike craft, as used by the Marines.
In 1989, the C and D models were further upgraded with expanded night attack capability by including the
AN/AAR -50 navpod, the AN/AAS -38 forward looking infrared (FLIR), the Litening  II targeting pod, and night vis ion
goggles. 1989 also saw the F/A-18 gain three full -color multipurpose displays, including adding color moving -map
capability to the center AMPCD.

 In 1989, during the first Gulf War, F/A -18 pilots
successfully shot down two MiG -21s during a strike
mission. The pilots were able to switch from the air -
to-ground to air -to-air role, destroy the MiGs within
40 seconds of the E -2C’s initial contact, then s wap
back to air -to-ground and complete their strike,
cementing the credibility of the multirole concept.
(You can play an Instant Action mission inspired by
these events in DCS, if you own the Persian Gulf
map.)
Through the 1990s, US F/A -18Cs and Ds served in
Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring
Freedom while continuing to see further technology
improvements. The F404 -GE-402 turbofan engine
was incorpor ated in 1992, adding 10% more static
thrust. In 1993, F/A-18’s began equipping the
AN/AAS -38A laser target designator/ranger (LTD/R), giving them the ability to target their own laser -guided
munitions. A year later the avionics received another bump, swapping the venerable AN/APG -65 for the powerful
and precise AN/APG -73 attack radar.
Production of the F/A -18C and D ended in August 2000. The last C
model was assembled in Finland for the Finnish Air Force. F/A-18’s
continued to serve the US for the nex t two decades. The C model’s
last cruise was aboard the USS Carl Vinson , which ended in April
of 2018, whereupon the Navy announced that the C models would
be retired from combat duty in February 2019. The aircraft was
honored with a retirement ceremony, b ut a few C -model F/A-18’s
continued to fly in training duty as aggressor aircraft, or in the
service of the Blue Angels. The final flight of an F/A -18C for the US
Navy was on October 2, 2019.
In all, nea rly one thousand C and D model F/A-18’s were produced,
and C models served in the armed forces of eight countries.
Though the United States has retired the C -model F/A-18’s, the
model still serves in the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Finnish Air Force, the  Kuwait Air Force, and the Swiss Air
Force.
The US Navy has since replaced its carrier fighter fleet with the F/A -18E and F models , representing a major leap
forward in the F/A-18’s capability and lethality on the battlefield. Though the E and F models sha re the name and
same basic appearance as the C and D models, they are a completely different design, with enlarged fuselage
and wings, an entirely new avionics suite and cockpit, upgraded engines, and many other improvements.
There are three US Navy F/A -18C’s on display in the US, with more coming as the Blue Angels transition to the
F/A-18E and F models:
• BuNo 163106, painted in Blue Angels #2 livery, is at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA
• BuNo 163439, painted in Blue Angels #1 livery, is at the Smithson ian Air and Space Museum in

 WEAPONS & MUNITIONS
M61A1 Vulcan 20mm Cannon
The F /A-18C is equipped with an M61 Vulcan internal cannon. The  M61 fires standard M50 20mm rounds at 6, 000
rounds per minute. It is effective against both surface and air targets. The ammunition drum carries 510 rounds.
The M61 in DCS can be loaded with a mix of live rounds and tracers, or with live rounds only.
AIM-9 Sidewinder
The AIM -9 Sidewinder is an infrared -guided (heat -seeking) short -range air -to-
air missile. It first entered service in 1956 and has since become one of the
most successful missiles in the West. Its longevity is thanks to its versatility and
continued improvement over multiple generations.
The AIM -9 uses an array of up to five scanning infrared sensors, cooled by an
internal argon bottle (L and M models). The Sidewinder has a maximum speed
of over Mach 2.5 and a maximum range of around 10 to 20 miles, depending
on the variant. Minimum range is around 3,000 feet.
The AIM -9 can be mounted directly to an LAU -127 on the wingtips, or up to
two Sidewinders can be mounted to an LAU -127 mated with an LAU -115C, which adapt s to the BRU -32 ejector
rack, allowing the missile to be mounted to the underwing pylons.
AIM-9L Sidewinder.  The 1977 “Lima” model was the first all -aspect Sidewinder, meaning it no longer required
the target to present a rear profile. The AIM -9L earned it s first kill when it struck a Libyan Su -22, after being fired
from an F -14 Tomcat, in the infamous Gulf of Sidra engagement of 1981.
AIM-9M Sidewinder.  The 1982 “Mike” model improved on the Guidance Control Section (GCS). Susceptibility
to flares was reduc ed, and background discrimination was improved, resulting in a greater chance of lock -on.
The motor ’s smoke signature was reduced, making the missile less likely to be detected.
AIM-9X Sidewinder.  The 2003 “X-ray” model is the latest iteration of the Sidew inder. The X -ray adds high off -
boresight (HOBS) capability and the ability to slave the seeker head to the JHMCS. The missile ’s maneuverability
was boosted with all -axis thrust -vectoring capability. These changes allow the pilot to simply “point their head
and shoot ” in nearly any direction, and the missile will make its way to the target. The infrared sensor was
replaced with focal -plane arrays (FPAs) and counter -countermeasures capability was improved further. Electronic
fuzing was added to reduce minimum  range.
CAP-9M. Captive variant of the AIM -9M. The captive variant has the same size, weight, and drag characteristics
as the AIM -9M, for training effectiveness. It also contains an integrated infrared sensor and will provide audio
and visual guidance cues  to the pilot, but it does not have a motor and does not release from the aircraft.

 AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM -120 AMRAAM is an active radar homing (ARH) medium -
range air -to-air missile. First introduced in 1982, the AMRAAM was
intended to replace the semi -active radar homing AIM -7 Sparrow,
which was the medium -range BVR missile in the US inventory at the
time.
The AIM -120 uses both command guidance and radar homing to
reach its target. The AIM -120’s integral radar has a comparatively
short r ange, and so until the missile is within that range, it is guided
by datalink commands sent automatically from the launching
aircraft. The AMRAAM has a maximum speed around Mach 4 and a
maximum range of 30 to 40 miles.
The AIM -120 is mounted to the LAU -127, which can be mounted in
singles or pairs to LAU -115C, allowing the missile to be mounted to the underwing pylons. It can also be mounted
directly to stations 4 and 6.
AIM-120B AMRAAM. This 1994 variant is the earliest variant still in production.
AIM-120C AMRAAM. The 1996 variant improved target detection, homing capability, and fuzing.
AIM-7 Sparrow
The AIM -7 Sparrow is a semi -active medium -range air -to-air missile.
Development on the Sparrow first began in 1949, when it was originally
conceived as a beamrider. The AAM -N-2 Sparrow I, this beam -rider variant,
entered service in 1954. Later prototypes were active radar -guided, but the
first Sparrow to enter widespread production was the AAM -N-6 Sparrow III
(later renamed the  AIM-7C). The AIM -7E saw extensive use in Vietnam,
where 612 were fired, resulting in 56 kills.
The modern AIM -7 has a maximum speed of Mach 4 and an operational range of up to 53 nautical miles, though
performance will depend on the intensity of the radar  energy reflected from the target. As a semi -active guided
missile, the launching aircraft must maintain a continuous radar lock on the target until impact.
The AIM -7 is mounted to the LAU -115C connected to underwing pylons.
AIM-7F Sparrow. The 1976 varian t had improved range thanks to a dual -stage rocket motor, solid -state
electronics, and a larger warhead than the E model.
AIM-7M Sparrow. The most common variant today, the M was first introduced in 1982 and used extensively
during the First Gulf War. Trac king reliability was greatly improved with the use of an inverse monopulse radar.
It also added active -radar proximity fuzing, better ECCM, and better performance at low altitudes.
AIM-7MH Sparrow.  This is the AIM -7M variant with a newer software version ( the H build). The upgraded
software improves guidance and loft performance.

 AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)
The AGM -154 is the result of a combined Navy/Air Force
venture to produce a precision -guided glide bomb, first
introduced in 1988 and first em ployed during Operation
Desert Fox. The AGM -154 uses an INS/GPS guidance
system to navigate to its target. The bomb is unpowered,
but the extending glide fins give it a range of around 70
nautical miles when dropped from high altitudes. The
bomb weighs aro und 1,000 pounds.
The AGM -154 development program is widely considered
to be one of the best successes in project management
in the defense industry. The program is often used as an
example in the industry and in academia.
AGM -154A. The baseline JSOW has a warhead containing 145 BLU -97/B combined effects submunitions. The
submunitions have anti -armor, anti -materiel, and anti -personnel effects. The AGM -154A is typically used as a
SEAD weapon.
AGM -154C. The unitary v ariant contains an infrared seeker used during the terminal phase and the penetrating
BROACH warhead. The BROACH warhead is a two -stage system designed for penetrating hardened bunkers. It
consists of the WDU -44 shaped augmenting warhead and the WDU -45 fol low-through bomb. The WDU -44
penetrates the armor layer, and the WDU -45 detonates within the interior chambers, amplifying its concussive
effects.
AGM-84 Harpoon , SLAM, and SLAM -ER
The AGM -84D Harpoon is a turbojet -powered sea -skimming
anti-ship missile with over -the-horizon attack capability. The
Harpoon uses INS mid -course guidance, then locates and guides
to its target using terminal attack radar. It then performs a
terminal pop -up maneuver just prio r to impact. The missile sea -
skims at around Mach 0.7 and contains a 500 -pound warhead
with impact fuzing. The missile weighs 1,500 pounds.
The AGM -84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) is a land
attack variant developed from the Harpoon. The SLAM enhances
the INS midcourse guidance with GPS updates, adds infrared -
homing terminal guidance and the capability for datalinked
seeker head video and datalinked command guidance, and
increases the warhead si ze to 1,000 pounds.
Both variants have a range more than 60 nautical miles.
The AGM -84K SLAM Extended Response (SLAM -ER) is an improvement over the SLAM that greatly improves its
range to around 150 nautical miles and adds improved terminal guidance capabi lities.

 AGM-88 HARM
The AGM -88 High -speed Anti -Radiation Missile (HARM) is a passive
radar homing air -to-ground missile used in the suppression of
enemy air defenses (SEAD) role. The HARM has a radar receiver
and processor that detects and identifies sig nals from enemy
surface radars. When launched, it can guide to the target by homing
on its specific radar emissions. The missile also has an inertial
guidance system to provide mid -course guidance prior to detection
of the radar signal (or if the signal is  lost).
The AGM -88 has a maximum speed of Mach 1.84 and an operational
range of around 80 nautical miles. It uses a laser proximity fuze for
detonation.
AGM -88C. This mid -1980s variant incorporates field -reprogrammable software  and improved guidance and
fuzing.
AGM-65 Maverick
The AGM -65 Maverick is a medium -range air -to-ground missile
designed for the close air support role. The AGM -65 family contains
a diverse set of variants and guidance systems, including infrared,
electro -optical, and laser guidance.
The AGM -65 has a maximum range of around 13 nautical miles. It
was first delivered in 1972. A single Maverick can be mounted to an
LAU-117 rack.
AGM -65E Maverick.  The E model uses laser guidance,  either from
the F/A-18C’s onboard  designator  or from another laser emitter. It
has a 300 -lb penetrating warhead with a delayed fuze.
AGM -65F Maverick.  The F model uses an infrared tracking system adapted for the anti -ship role. It has the
same warhead as the Maverick E.
AGM-62 Walleye II
The AGM -62 Walleye II is a television -guided glide bomb dating back
to 1963 and used principally during the Vietnam War. The original
AGM-62 models used image centroid tracking like electro -optical
Mavericks; newer models also added datalinked video and co mmand
guidance capability.
The AGM -62 has a 2,000 -lb high -explosive warhead. Despite being
designated “AGM,” the AGM -62 is an unpowered glide bomb.

247 Mk. 118 Mo d 1 bomblets. Each bomblet contains a shaped
charge capable of penetrating several inches of armor. Rockeyes
were used extensively during Operation Desert Storm to attrit
Iraqi tank battalions. The Mk. 20 and CBU -99 are unguided free -
fall bombs.
Mk. 20 Roc keye.  The baseline variant is used for shore -based
operations.
CBU-99. This variant has increased thermal protection and is
used for shipboard operations.
The Rockeye can be mounted in pairs on a BRU -33 rack.
Paveway II Laser Guided Bomb
The Paveway II is a series of laser -guided bombs based on conventional
general -purpose bombs. The guidance kit consists of a laser detector and
processor in the front and a set of steering fins in the back. The bomb
detects and tracks reflected laser energy off a target. The laser
designation can come from the launching aircraft, another aircraft
(“buddy lasing”), or from a laser -capable ground unit such as a JTAC.
The Paveway II series  was introduced in the early 1970s to replace the
first-generation Paveway series of laser -guided bombs. The Paveway II
improved sensor reliability and added extendible rear fins to extend glide
range. The Paveway II series uses “bang -bang” control (where the fins
can only deflect fully in either direction), limiting its maximum range and forcing it to follow a sinusoidal path to
the target.

 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)
JDAM is a kit that modifies a Mk. 80 -series conventional bomb,
giving it precision INS/GPS guidance capability. The JDAM kit
consists of a GPS receiver, integral INS, and steerable fins. JDAM
bombs must downlink target coordinates prior to release and
cannot be manually steered or re -targeted after release. Modern
JDAM kits have a precision of around 25 feet circular error
probable (CEP).
The Joint Direct Attack Munition program began after Operation
Desert Storm, when the US Air Force sought a weapon that could
guide more reliably than an LGB in adverse weather such as dust
storms. After extensive testing, the concept  of an INS/GPS -guided
bomb was shown to be effective by 1993, and the first JDAM kits
were delivered to operational squadrons in 1997.

• A/A: Air -to-Air
• X: X Band
• Y: Y Band
Now you can actuate the ON/OFF selector pushbutton to turn the TACAN system on. The TACAN channel number
may be changed using the UFC keypad. In the T/R mode the TACAN computes bearing, and measures slant
range from t he selected TACAN station. In the RCV mode only bearing from the selected TACAN station is
computed. In the A/A mode, interrogations and replies are only single pulse from one aircraft to another. TACAN
with bearing and range information is plotted on the HSI. When TACAN is boxed on the HSI, range information
is displayed on the HSI and HUD. With a course line selected and in NAV mode, steering information is displayed
on the HUD and the distance course line is displayed in the lower right corner of the HSI  with a C beside it. For
example: 15 miles from course line would be displayed as “15 C”. This is very useful on the downwind leg of a
carrier landing pattern by selecting the carrier TACAN, set the carrier course line, and then fly 1.2 miles abeam
of the course line on the downwind leg parallel to the course line until starting the 180° turn.

 Advanced Multipurpose Color Display (AMPCD)
The AMPCD (generally referred to as just the MPCD)  is a full-color, NVG compatible digital display capable of
providing any MENU selectable format except the A/G radar display. The MPCD is dr iven by either the Digital Map
Set (DMS) for HSI displays, or the left DDI for all other MENU selectable formats. Four momentary two -position
rocker switches and a rotary knob, located on the front of the MPCD, permit control of MPCD off/brightness,
night/ day viewing modes, symbology, gain, and contrast.

Figure 9. MPCD
1. Off/Brightness Control . This rotary switch powers  on the AMPCD when it is rotated out of the OFF
position. When DAY is selected on the night/day brightness selector, AMPCD brightness is controlled
using this rotary. When NGT is selected, brightness is controlled automatically . (Brightness is always
controlled automatically when the HSI format is shown on the AMPCD.)
2. Night/Day Brightness Selector . This rocker switch toggles between auto and manual brightness
control. When DAY is pressed, AMPCD brightness can be adjusted using the brightness knob to the

Standby Attitude Reference Indicator (SARI)
This is a self-contained instrument to indicate aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw.

Figure 12. SARI
[F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  55

 The standby attitude reference indicator (SARI) is a self -contained electrically driven gyro -horizon type instrument
An OFF flag appears if both  power sources fail, or if the gyro is caged. During caging the gyro initially cages to
4° pitch and 0° roll regardless of aircraft attitude. Cagi ng when the aircraft is in a roll attitude greater than 5°
cuts out the roll erection system and the gyro does not erect properly. After 3 to 5 minutes, the indicator reads
0° in pitch and 0° in roll. Both readings assume the aircraft is straight and level. Pitch display is limited by
mechanical stops at approximately 90° climb and 80° dive. As the aircraft re aches a near vertical orientation, the
roll display experiences large rotations. An aircraft wings level attitude in the vertical orientation may result in
large errors in either pitch or roll, or both. This is normal and is not an indication of damage or improper function
of the indicator. After completion of vertical maneuvers, the indicator most likely requires caging in the normal
cruise attitude, to eliminate the errors. Vertical maneuvers with a wing down condition of 7° or more usually do
not develop  significant gyro errors. A needle and ball are at the bottom of the instrument. A one -needle width
turn is 90° per minute.
Turn the knob at the bottom right to set the zero -pitch index. Pull the knob to cage the attitude indicator.
Azimuth Indicator
Also referred to as the Radar  Warning Receiver  (RWR), this is discussed in the Defensive Systems section of this

The standby airspeed indicator displays  airspeed from 60 to 850 knots indicated airspeed. It operates directly off
left pitot pressure and left static pressure with N ORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static
pressure with BACKUP selected.
Standby Altimeter
Indication of aircraft barometric altitude.  The standby altimeter is a counter -pointer t ype. The counter drum
indicates altitude in thousands of feet from 00 to 99. The long pointer indicates altitude in 50 -foot increments
with one full revolution each 1,000 feet. A knob and window permit setting the altimeter to the desired barometric
settin g. This setting is also used by the air data computer. The standby altimeter operates directly off the left
static pressure with NORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static pressure with BACKUP
selected.
Standby Vertical Velocity In dicator
Indication of  aircraft positive or negative change of altitude rate.
HMD Control
Rotating the HMD knob clockwise activates the Helmet Mounted  Sight and adjusts brightness. Please see the
Helmet Mounted Display (HMD)  chapter.
Spin Recovery
This control is a hold -over from earlier production lots of the F/A-18C. During later development of the F/A-18C’s
flight control system, this switch and system was rendered obs olete. In fact, in official F/A-18C flight manuals, it
is prohibited from use. Although we have fully -modeled this system for complete accuracy, it should not be used.  DCS [F/A-18C]

 The spin recovery system, when engaged, puts the flight controls in a spin recovery mode  (SRM). This mode,
unlike CAS, gives the pilot full aileron, rudder and stabilator authority without any control surface interconnects
and all rate and acceleration feedbacks are removed. The leading -edge flaps are driven to 33° ±1° down and the
trailing e dge flaps are driven to 0° ±1°.
• NORM. Spin recovery mode engaged when all the following conditions are met:
o Airspeed 120 ±15 knots.
o Sustained, un -commanded yaw rate.
o Stick is placed in the direction indicated on the DDI spin recovery display.
o The flight controls revert to CAS anytime the stick is placed in the wrong direction (i.e.,
pro-spin), the airspeed increases above about 245 knots, or the yaw rate decreases to less
than 15°/second.
• RCVY. Spin mode engaged when airspeed is 120 ±15 knots. The flight controls revert to CAS when
the airspeed increases  above about 245 knots. Full authority pro-spin controls can be applied with
the switch in RCVY, and spin mode engaged.

Canopy Jettison Handle
The black and yellow striped canopy jettison handle  is on the left inboard canopy sill just aft of the instrument
panel. Pulling the handle aft activates the canopy jettison system.
Landing Gear Handle  [G]
The landing gear is controlled by a two -position, wheel -shaped handle on the lower left side of the main
instrument panel. Two conditions must be met before the gear can be raised: the aircraft must sense that weight
is off all three -landing gear and the launch bar must be retracted . When these con ditions are met, the landing
gear is raised by moving the handle up. If the launch bar is extended when the handle is raised, the main gear
retracts but the nose gear remains extended. When the aircraft senses weight on any of the three -landing gear,
a mec hanical stop in the landing gear control panel extends preventing movement of the handle from DN to UP.
Moving the handle down lowers the gear.
The landing gear warning light is a red light in the gear handle. The light comes on when the gear is in transit
and remains on until all three gear are down and locked when DN is selected, or all the gear doors are closed
when UP is selected. The light remains on with the gear down and locked if the left or right main landing gear
link is not locked. When the landi ng gear handle light has been on for 15 seconds the landing gear aural tone
also comes on.
Emergency gear extension is done by rotating the gear handle 90° clockwise and pulling to the detent where the
handle locks in place  (in the sim, this is done with t he mousewheel) . This can be done with the handle in either
UP or DN; however, the handle must be rotated 90° before it is pulled. Rotating and pulling the gear handle

 opens the valves for the emergency landing gear control, the APU accumulator and the emer gency brake
accumulator. The nose landing gear extends by free fall aided by air  loads, and the main landing gear extends
by free fall aided by the side brace down  lock actuator and the compressed shock absorber. If gear indicates
unsafe following emergenc y extension, it may be the result of the APU accumulator arming valve not opening .
Launch Bar S witch
The launch bar is hydraulically extended and retracted by redundant springs. A locking tab mechanically locks
the launch bar in the up position. The two position (EXTEND and RETRACT) launch bar switch controls launch
bar operation. As the launch  bar extend s the green L BAR advisory light comes on. When the launch bar is fully
extended it is held against the deck by load control springs. The control springs allow vertical movement of the
launch bar during taxi. As the aircraft is taxied into the launch gear the launch bar drops over the shuttle and is
held captive in the extended position as the shuttle is tensioned. The green L BAR advisory light goes out when
the switch is placed to RETRACT. If the red L BAR warning light is on with the switch in RETRACT, a n electrical
fault exists which prevents launch bar retraction after launch. At the completion of the catapult stroke, launch
bar/catapult separation occurs and the return springs cause launch bar retraction which allows the landing gear
to be retracted. I f the launch bar fails to retract after the aircraft is launched, the red L BAR warning light comes
on and the nosewheel  does not retract. A launch bar circuit breaker is on the left essential circuit breaker panel
and when pulled de -energizes the launch b ar electrical system.
Flap Switch
The FLAP switch selects which of the two flight control computer modes (auto flap up or takeoff and land) is
active and thus determines the flight characteristics for those conditions.
• AUTO . Without Weight on Wheels  (WOW),  leading and trailing edge flaps are scheduled as a
function of AoA. With WOW, leading and trailing edge flaps and aileron droop are set to  0°. [F]
• HALF. Below 250 knots, leading edge flaps are scheduled as a function  of AoA. Trailing edge flaps
and ailero n droop are scheduled as a function of airspeed to a maximum of 30° at approach
airspeeds. Above 250 knots, the flaps operate in the auto flap up mode and the amber FLAPS light
comes on. On the ground, the leading -edge flaps are set to 12°. The trailing ed ge flaps and aileron
droop are set to 30°. With the wing unlocked, aileron droop is set to 0 °. [LShift] + [F]
• FULL. Below 250 knots, leading edge flaps are scheduled as a function of AoA. Trailing edge flaps
and aileron droop are scheduled as a function of  airspeed to a maximum of 45° flaps and 42° aileron
droop at approach airspeeds. Above 250 knots, the flaps operate in the auto flaps up mode and the
amber FLAPS light comes on. On the ground, the leading -edge flaps are set to 12°. The trailing edge
flaps are set to 43° to 45° and aileron droop to 42°. With the wings unlocked, aileron droop is set to
0°. [LCtrl] + [F]
Selective Jettison Kn ob
The selective jettison knob on the left vertical panel has rotary positions L FUS MSL, SAFE, R FUS MSL,
RACK/LCHR, and STORES. L FU S MSL and R FUS MSL selects the required fuselage missile for jettison. The
RACK/LC HR and STORES positions select what is to be jettisoned from the weapon stations selected by the station
jettison select buttons. The JETT center pushbutton activates the jettison circuits provided the landing gear is up
and locked and the master arm switch is in ARM. The SAFE position prevents any selective jettison.  DCS [F/A-18C]

 Landing / Taxi Li ght
This is a combination landing and taxi light located  on the n ose gear strut. The light is controlled by the LDG/TAXI
light switch on the left vertical panel.
• OFF. Light is off.
• ON. If the  landing gear handle is in DN and the landing gear is down, the light is on.
Anti-Skid Swi tch
The anti -skid circuit prevents brake application  on landing until wheel speed is over 50 knots, or if a wet runway
delays wheel spin -up, 3 second s after touchdown. A locked wheel protect ion circuit releases the brakes if the
speed of one main wheel is 40% of the other main wheel. The locked wheel protection circuit is disabled at about
35 knots. The anti -skid system is totally disabled below 10 knots. Anti -skid is used for airfield operation, but not
for carrier operations.
Emergency / Parking Brake Handle
The combination emergency/parking brake handle is on the lower left corner of the main instrument panel. The
handle is shaped such that EMERG is visible to the pilot when the handle is in the stowed or emergency position
and PARK is visible to the pilot wh en the handle is rotated to the park position.
The parking brake system uses the same hydraulic lines, accumulators , and actuation handle as the emergency
brake system. The system is activated by rotating the emergency/parking brake handle 90° counterclock wise
from the horizontal stowed position and pulling it out to a positive locked position. If the emergency brakes have
been activated, it is necessary to reposition the handle to the stowed position then rotate it 90° counterclockwise
and pull it to the l ocked position to select parking brakes. This action applies non -regulated pressure to the disc
brakes. With the INS on, the parking brake set, and both throttles above about 80% rpm, the PARK BRK caution
and MASTER CAUTION come on. To release the parking brake, rotate the emergency/ parking brake handle 45°
counterclockwise from the extended position. This releases the lock and allows the handle to return to the
horizontal stowed position.
Brake Accumulator Pressure G auge
Brake accumulator pressure i s show n on a pressure  gauge on the lower left corner of the main instru ment panel
and is redlined to indicate pressure below 2,000 psi. 3,000 psi is a normal level.
Arrestor Hook Bypass S witch
With this switch set to the CARRI ER position, the AoA I ndexer Lights will light solid when the arrestor  hook and
landing gear are down and locked. It will however flash if the arrestor hook is up. When set to FIELD, the AoA
Indexer Lights will stay solid when the arrestor hook is not down.  Lowering the arresting hook will r elease a
solenoid and move the switch to the CARRIER position.

Three lighting controls c omprise this panel:
• Position Lights . The position lights include a white light just below the tip of the right vertical tail
fin, three green lights on the right side of the aircraft, and three red lights on the left side of the
aircraft.  The position lights are controlled by the POSITION lights knob. The exterior lights master
switch must be ON for the position lights knob to operate.
• Formation Lights . Eight formation lights are provided. Two lights are on each wing tip, two lights
are on  the outboard of the vertical tail fins, two lights are on the aft fuselage below the vertical tail
fins, and two lights are on either side of the forward fuselage just forward of the LEX. The formation
lights are controlled by the FORMATION lights control  knob on the exterior lights panel which
provides variable lighting between positions OFF and BRT. The exterior lights master switch must be
ON for the formation lights knob to operate.
• Strobe Lights . Two red anti -collision strobe lights, one on each outbo ard vertical tail fin, are
provided. The strobe lights are controlled by the STROBE lights switch on the exterior lights panel.
The exterior lights master switch must be ON for the strobe lights switch to be operative.
o OFF Lights are off.
o BRT Lights illumi nate at full intensity.
o DIM Lights illuminate  at reduced intensity.
APU and Engine Crank P anel
The APU switch is a two -position switch with positions of ON and OFF. OFF Provides a manual shutdown for the
APU. ON Starts the start cycle of the APU. Switch is electrically held in the ON position and automatically returns
to OFF 1 minute after the secon d generator comes  on the line.
The APU is a small aircraft mounted gas turbine engine used to  generate a source of air to power  the air turbine
starter(s) . It is situated on the underside of the fuselage between the engines, with both intake and  exhaust
facing downwards. A hydraulic motor powered by the APU accumulator, normally charged by  HYD 2B, is used to
start the APU. A hand pump may be used to charge the accumulator. The aircraft  battery provides electrical
power for the APU ignition and start control  circuits. The APU uses aircraft  fuel.
Operation of the APU is automatic after the APU switch, on the left console, is placed to ON. The  APU may be
shut down at any time by placing the APU switch to OFF. After the APU has completed  its start cycle a green
READY light comes on. After the second generator is online , the APU runs  approximately 1 minute then the APU
switch returns to OFF.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  63

 Either engine may be started first; however, starting the right engine first provides normal hydraulic pressure to
the brake s. After the APU READY light is on, place  the electrically held engine crank switch to R. This opens the
right air turbine starter control valve .
(ATSCV) and APU air powers the ATS. The ATS in turn cranks the right engine by way of the AMAD  gearbox and
power transmission shaft. After the right generator comes online  the engine crank  switch automatically returns
to OFF. The left engine is started the same way as the right. One minute  after the second generator comes online
the APU shuts down.
Flight Control System (FCS) P anel
Movement of the rudder trim knob on the FCS control panel  electrically biases the flight control computers. The
rudder pedals do not move.
The T/O trim button is in the center of the rudder trim knob on the  FCS panel. With WOW, holding t he button
down  drives the roll and yaw trim to the neutral position,  stabilator 12° nose  up, and zeros the mechanical stick
position. When the roll and yaw control surfaces are trimmed to neutral and the stabilator to  12° nose up, the
TRIM advisory is displayed on the DDI until the button is released. In flight, pressing the T/O trim button only
neutralizes the mechanical  stick position.

• New RWR spike detected. This single, short tone is heard when a new RWR signal is detected.
• Launch tone. When a radar guided missile launch is detected, this repeating, multi -pitch tone is heard
while the threat is detected.
FCS Voice Alerts. Any FCS caution except CHECK TRIM, FCS, NWS, FC AIR DAT, g-LIM OVRD, or R -LIM OFF is
accompanied by a “flight controls, “flight controls ” voice alert. An engine fire would be result in “Engine Fire Left”
and/or “Engine Fire Right”. An APU fire woul d result in “APU Fire”. A bleed air failure will result in either a “Bleed
Air Left” and/or “Bleed Air Right”.
• “Flight controls, flight controls”
• “Engine fire left, engine fire left”
• “Engine fire right, engine fire right”
• “APU fire, APU fire”
• “Bleed air le ft, bleed air left”
• “Bleed air right, bleed air right”
• “Flight computer hot”
• “Fuel low”
• “Bingo”
• “Altitude”
All voice alerts are repeated twice ( e.g., “Engine Fire Left, Engine Fire Left ”)
Primary Radar Low Altitude Warning. If the landing gear is up and lo cked and the radar  altitude is less than
the Low Altitude Limit index, the primary low altitude warning tone/voice alert  is heard in the pilot ’s headset. A
“whoop whoop”  warning  tone is heard. The voice alert or warning tone is activated at ground power -up to
familiarize the pilot  with the warning. When  first activated in flight, the warning is continuously repeated until
reset or disabled. The warning is reset by setting the low altitude index to an altitude below the present altitude
or by climbin g to an altitude above the low altitude index setting. The warning can be disabled by  pressing the
RALT button on the UFC or by commanding the UFC to another mode. Once disabled  it cannot be triggered until
after being reset as described above.
With an MC1  failure, the voice alert/warning tone is not sounded when  the aircraft descends below the altitude
set by the low altitude index  pointer.
With landing gear down, the radar altimeter warning sounds once when the aircraft descends through the set
altitude.

 CONTROL STICK  & THROTTLES
Control Stick
The stick contains the pitch and roll trim switch, sensor control switch, Air -to-Ground bomb release button,
gun/forward -firing weapons trigger, Air -to-Air weapon select switch, undesignate /nosewheel  steering button. An
autopilot/ nosewheel  steering disengage switch (paddle switch) is mounted below the stick grip. Stick position
sensors transmit an electrical signal proportional to  stick displacement from neutral to the flight control
computers.
Several of the switches have multiple functions that depend on a selected mode. We will discuss those in the
later, relevant sections of this manual.

 If the nosewheel steering system fails, NWS and FCS are displayed on the DDI as cautions, the MASTER
CAUTION light comes on, and the NWS or NWS HI di splay is removed from the HUD. When failed, the
nosewheel steering system reverts to a free swiveling mode.
Undesignate . When  not in a nose -wheel steering state (weight off wheels), this button is used to
undesignate  a previously designated target or location. This commands radar return to search and
undesignate s targets.

Nosewheel steering disengage  [A]. This paddle switch has  multiple functions depending on the state of the
aircraft. Functions include:
• Nosewheel  Steering . Disengages commanded nosewheel  steering . If the high mode is desired
during taxi, press and hold the nosewheel  steering button. If the wings are folded and N WS is
engaged, high gain mode is entered by pressing and releasing the NWS button.
• Autopilot Disengage . Disengage the commanded autopilot  mode and return to manually controlled
flight.
• G Limiter Override . The g limiter may be overridden by momentarily pres sing the paddle switch
with the control stick near full aft. Command limit g is then increased by 33%. A g-LIM OVRD caution
is displayed , and the MASTER CAUTION light and tone come on. Override is disengaged when the
control stick is returned to near neutr al.
Pitch and roll trim switch . Normally, movement of the pitch ([RCtrl]  + [.] and [RCtrl]  + [;]) and  roll
([RCtrl]  + [,] and [RCtrl]  + [/]) trim switch electrically biases the flight controls  and the stick does not move
(unlike the A -10C and Black Shark). Little if any pitch trim is required in the AUTO flap mode due to the automatic
trimming functions within the flight control computers. Only in landing configuration will manual  pitch trim be
required. If there is asymmetric loading, roll trim will be required. In MECH, pitch trim moves the control stick
fore and aft, changing the stick neutral point. There is no mechanical lateral trim.
Trim changes the tracked g loading up to 25 ° AoA. It is normally 1 g. Disengaging the autopilot in a level 2 g,
60° bank angle turn will leave the stick trimmed for 2 g. This then requires significant stick force to hold the nose
down while in level flight. Re -engaging either Altitude Hold or Attitude Hold with  wings level should reset the trim
back to 1 g. To better support game play, it is suggested that the aircraft return to 1 g when AP is disengaged
under all conditions.
If flaps are down, pitch trim functions like other trim switches, holding the trim swit ch results in continuous linear
changes until the switch is released. Trim input with flaps down sets the flight control computers to target an
angle of attack. With flaps up, trim inputs more than one second are ignored. Trim inputs with flaps up results in
changes to tracked g.

Recce event mark [R]. In the early access, this can be used to blank the helmet mounted display when pressed.

Weapon select switch . Four position switch which selects A/A weapon in A/A aircraft master mode. Switch
functions are d iscrete inputs.
• Forward [LShift ] + [W]: Activates AIM -7, displays the priority missile. Commands a radar antenna
four bar elevation, 140° azimuth scan, 40 -mile range selection, and interleaved PRF.
• Center Push [LShift ] + [S]: Activates AIM -9 and displays the priority missile. Command s a radar
antenna four bar elevation, 80° azimuth scan, 40-mile range selection for AIM -9L, AIM-9M and AIM-
9X, and interleaved PRF. DCS [F/A-18C]

 • Aft [LShift ] + [X]: Activates gun and displays gun. Commands GACQ to the radar system, a range
of 5nmi, radar antenna a zimuth scan of five bars, with 20° elevation scan (vertical scan). Configures
sensor control switch to the ACM condition.
• Right [LShift ] + [D]: Activates AIM -120 and displays priority missile. Commands a radar antenn a
two-bar elevation, 80° azimuth scan, 40-mile range selection for AIM -120B/ C, and interleaved PRF.
Note : If a target is tracked as the L&S, the weapon select switch should only change the weapon and not affect
radar operation based on weapon selection.
Sensor control switch (4 position) . This is a four position, momentary, centering switch. Switch functions
are discrete inputs.
• Forward [RAlt ] + [;]: When in NAV or A/G  mode, this assigns  throttle designator control (TDC)
priority to Head -Up Display (HUD). When in A/A mode, this also places the HUD in the ACM sub -
mode and radar in boresight .
• Aft [RAlt ] + [.]: When in A/G mode, this assigns  TDC priority to Advanced Multipurpose Color
Displa y (AMPCD). When in A/A mode, this assigns the TDC to the AMPCD SA page. If in an A/A ACM
sub-mode, this puts radar in vertical acquisition (VACQ). If in NAV mode, this toggles the AMPCD
between the HS I and SA formats .
• Left [LAlt ] + [,]: Assigns TDC priorit y to the LDDI. If TDC priority is already assigned to the LDDI
and LDDI is radar display, commands radar to track mode STT when TDC is over a radar return. If
radar is tracking, commands break lock (not undesignate ). In A/A ACM sub -mode, commands wide
acquisition (WACQ) to radar system. If TGP FLIR is displayed on the LDDI, it will command a track in
either A/A or A/G.
• Right [RAlt ] + [/]: Assigns TDC priority to the RDDI. If TDC priority is already assigned to the
RDDI and RDDI is radar display, commands ra dar to track mode STT when TDC is over a radar
return. If TGP FLIR is displayed  on the RDDI, it will command a track in either A/A or A/G.
Note:  All ACM modes will automatically lock a target.

 Throttles
The throttle grips contain switches that provide va rious systems control without moving the hand from the
throttles. As with the control stick, the HOTAS functions of the throttles vary in functionality depending on the
state and operational modes of the aircraft. These are discussed in the appropriate sections of this document.

Figure 21. Throttles
Dispense Switch, AFT  - OFF - FWD . This three -way switch allows manual and semi -automatic use of the ALE -
47 countermeasure system .
• Forward  [E]. Activates countermeasures program 5.
• Center . No function.
• Aft [D]. Activates the countermeasures program selected on the EW page.
When the Dispenser selector knob is in BYPASS, the switch has an alternate function:
• Forward  [E]. Dispenses a single chaff .
• Center . No function.
• Aft [D]. Dispenses a single flare .
Communications, COMM1  - COMM2  - MIDS A - MIDS B . This is a four -position switch that controls
transmission over the four radios.
• Forward.  Transmit over COMM1.
• Aft. Transmit over COMM2.
• Down.  Transmit over MIDS A.

 automatically retracts above 6.0 g or  above 28° AOA and, when not in the auto flaps up mode, below 250 knots.
The speedbrake will automatically retract if flaps are extended unless the speedbrake switch is held aft. T he
speedbrake extends with the flaps HALF or FULL so long as the switch is held in EXTEND.  The speedbrake can
be commanded to extend to any intermediate position but will retract fully with a momentary forward press of
the speedbrake switch. The spee dbrake operates normally on the ground.
With flaps extended and weight on wheels  (after landing or during an abort for example), the speed brake
remains extended without holding the speed brake switch aft.
• Aft [LShift ] + [B]. Extends the speed brake while the switch is held aft. Spring -loaded to center
detent.
• Forward  [LCtrl ] + [B]. Retracts the speed brake or maintains the speed brake retracted and
prevents creep.
• Center  [B]. Speedbrake will creep closed if open when speed is greater than 400 kts.

CAGE/UNCAGE button  [C]. This switch has multiple functions that depend on the active sy stem or weapon.
• NAV Mode . Used to cage or uncage the velocity vector on the HUD.
• A/A Mode, AIM -9. Controls Sidewinder  seeker position. AIM-9 seeker head is boresighted until L&S
designation, then it is slaved to the L&S. Pressing the cage button with an L& S, toggles the seeker
head between the L&S and boresight. Pressing and holding the cage button with the AIM -9 seeker
head in boresight, then maneuvering the aircraft to point at a target heat source, achieving AIM -9
tone rise, then releasing the cage butto n will result in  AIM-9 seeker head tracking the heat source to
the gimbals of the missile.
• A/A Mode, AIM -7. In A/A mode with Sparrow missile selected, commands radar into STT on the
L&S target.
• A/G Mode, Maverick . Cages the Maverick to boresight, or uncage s it and allows it to slew .
Throttle Designator Controller (TDC) . Upon setting TDC to one of the displays, the TDC acts as a slew control
to move the cursor / sensor. Controls are u p [;], down [.], left [,], right [/], and depress [Enter] .
• Not pressed, with left or right force applied:  Positions acquisition symbol left or right at rate
proportional to pressure applied to control.
• Not pressed with up or down force applied:  Positions acquisition symbol up or down at rate
proportional to pressure a pplied to control.
• Pressed:  Starts acquisition phase. Positions acquisition symbol or designator cursors depending on
direction of force applied to control.
• Released (cursor in tactical area of display):  Commands radar lock -on, target designation, or
active processing depending on mode of operation.
With the “Realistic TDC Slew” option enabled under the Special settings for the F/A -18C, the TDC must be held
down to slew certain display formats, such as the AGM -65 Maverick.
Antenna eleva tion control . The AN/APG -73 radar can have its antenna dish rotated up and down to alter the
radar elevation scan. This rotary allows the pilot to position the antenna elevation scan. Controls are u p [=] and
down [-]. [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  77

 Exterior lights switch  [L]. The exteri or lights master switch, on the outboard left throttle grip, provides a
master control for the following exterior lights: position lights, formation lights, strobe lights , and refueling probe
light.
• OFF (AFT) . Power for lights controlled by switch is cut o ff.
• ON (FWD) . Power is available  for lights controlled by switch.
RAID/FLIR FOV select button [I]. Depending on the controlled sensor or weapon, this button has multiple
functions:
• Selects the RAID mode when the radar set operating mode is Track While Scan (TWS) or Single
Target Track (STT).
• When HARM is selected , cycles HARM targets from center outwards.
• When ATFLIR or TGP is active, cycles between FOV settings.
• When in Maverick mode, toggles  FOV.

ATC Engage/Disengage  [T]. The ATC approach mode is eng aged by pressing and releasing the  ATC button
on the left throttle with the flap switch in HALF or FULL and the trailing edge flaps  extended at least 27°. When
ATC is engaged in the approach mode, the flight control computer  modulates engine thrust  to main tain on -speed
AOA. The computer uses inputs of AOA, normal load  factor, stabilator position, pitch rate, and angle of bank to
generate command signals. These signals  drive the engine mounted throttle control units which in turn command
the engine fuel cont rols. The  computer uses AOA as the primary input to generate command signals. However,
normal load factor  provides increased stability, stabilator position provides increased or decreased thrust  for pilot
induced  pitch changes, pitch rate provides lead dur ing pitch maneuvers, and bank angle provides additional  thrust
during banking maneuvers. Normal disengagement is accomplished by pressing the ATC button  or applying and
holding force to either throttle. Automatic disengagement occurs for the following  reasons:
• Flap AUTO up
• AOA sensor failure
• Two or more failures of either trailing edge flap
• Trailing edge flap deflection less than 27°
• ATC button fails
• FCES channel 2 or 4 fails
• WOW
• FCS reversion to MECH or to DEL in any axis
• Left and right throttle angles dif fer by more than 10° for more than 1 second
• Bank angle exceeds 70°
• Any internal system failure
• Selection of gain ORIDE

ATC Cruise Mode. The ATC cruise mode is engaged by pressing and releasing the ATC  button on the left throttle
with the flap switch in AUTO. When ATC is engaged in the cruise mode, the  existing airspeed is used by the flight
control computer to modulate engine thrust  to maintain this  existing airspeed. The existing airspeed is the
airspeed  being sent from the ADC to the flight control  computers via the mission computers. An ADC failure
inhibits the ATC cruise mode of operation. The  FCC uses true airspeed from ADC via the mission computers at
the time of engagement to generate a  command signal. This signal is then used as a reference to gen erate an
error signal that drives the  engine mounted throttle control units. Normal disengagement is accomplished by
pressing the ATC  button or applying and holding force to either throttle. Automatic disengagement occurs for the
following reasons:
• Flaps H ALF or FULL
• ATC button fails  DCS [F/A-18C]
