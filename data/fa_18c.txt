 INTRODUCTION
Thank you for your purchase of DCS: F/A-18C!
DCS: F/A-18C brings to Digital Combat Simulator an iconic aircraft of modern naval aviation . This module features
the most realistic PC simulation of the F /A-18C, which includes accurately simulated flight dynamics, avionics,
sensors, and weapon systems. This module simulates the F /A-18C as it existed in United States Navy and Marine
Corps service circa 200 5.
The F /A-18C is one of the most successful naval strike fighters in modern history; and has served as the backbone
of U.S. Navy carrier air wings for decades, as well as serving in the air  forces of several other  nations ranging
from Europe, to the Middle East, to the Pacific region.  Known for its dual-role design, mission versatility, and of
course its ability to operate from aircraft carriers at sea, the F/A -18C is also one of the most maneuverable aircraft
in close -range air -to-air combat  with a robust fly -by-wire control system and high angle -of-attack capabilities.
When used in conjunction with the DCS: Supercarrier  module, the DCS: F/A -18C gives DCS players the most
authentic U.S. Naval Aviation experience available for the PC, short of strapping on a G -suit yourself and tasting
the salty air first -hand.
Hook up, salute, and launch yourself into naval aviation!
Key features:
• Detailed, fully -clickable, 6DOF  cockpit along with a highly detailed external model.
• APG-73 Fire Control Radar (with air -to-air and air -to-ground modes), ATFLIR and L itening  II targeting pods,
and Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS).
• Air-to-air weapons include the M61 20mm Vulcan cannon, AIM -9 Sidewinder heat -seeking missiles, AIM -7
Sparrow semi -active radar -homing missiles , and AIM -120 AMRAAM active radar -homing missiles.
• A large assortment of air -to-ground munitions, including (but not  limited to) AGM -88 HARM anti -radar
missiles, AGM -65 IR - and laser -guided Maverick anti -armor missiles, AGM -84D Harpoon anti -ship missiles,
AGM-84E/H SLAM long -range attack missiles, AGM -62 Walleye TV -guided glide bombs, AGM -154 JSOW glide
bombs, JDAM iner tially aided munitions, and Paveway laser -guided bombs.
• DL16 datalink, providing a high degree of situational awareness and teamwork between wingmen.
• ALR-67(V) r adar warning  receiver, ALE -47 countermeasure dispensers, and ALQ -165 ECM jamming system.
• Comple te integration with DCS: Supercarrier module.
• Fly missions in the Black Sea  region or one of the many DLC maps like the Persian Gulf, Syria, and more.
• Multiplayer cooperative and head -to-head gameplay.

Author’s note:  The DCS F/A -18C Early Access Guide has been migrated to a new standardized format and
structure. As part of this update, several user -reported errors or confusing descriptions have been updated. In
addition, the appendix at the end of the manual that lists hostile radar symbols with their corresponding ALIC
codes and HARM classes has also been updated to reflect the current threat  radars  within DCS World.
As a whole, the F/A -18C Early Access Guide requires a larger revision to not only bring it up to date with the
current state of the DCS F/A -18C module, but to bring it up to the high standards that are expected of DCS
aircraft modules. It is my intention t o complete the F/A -18C manual with the same level of dedication and
attention to detail; however this process will take time  (as similar updates are being performed for the A -10C, A-
10C II, F -16C, and AH -64D manuals) , and I appreciate your patience.

 FLIGHT CONTROL
Primary aircraft flight controls include the  Control Stick, Throttle s, and Rudder Pedals. The stick is used to roll the
aircraft left and right to perform turns , and pitch the nose up and down to climb or descend. The throttle s are
used to control engine power and airspeed. The pedals are used in flight to yaw the a irplane left and right using
the rudder (like a boat) ; and on the ground to turn the nose wheel when taxiing.
If you are flying with only a keyboard, the primary flight control keys will be the arrow keys to control roll and
pitch, [Numpad+]  and [Numpad -] to control throttle, and [Z] / [X] to control the rudder pedals. If you do
have a joystick, it may be equipped with a throttle handle and/or a twist grip, which will allow you to control the
rudder pedals.

When flying from the cockpit, the Controls Indicator display  may be toggled  by pressing  [RCtrl] +[Enter]  to see
a visual reference of the positions of your flight controls.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  23

 Changing Airspeed
There are several methods to increase or decrease airspeed:
• Aircraft engine power.  When advancing the throttles, the engines will produce more thrust.
Likewise, retarding the throttles will produce less thrust.
• Aircraft pitch angle and pitch rate.  Generally, pitching the nose up above the horizon will cause
the aircraft to slow down; and pitching the nose down below the horizon will cause th e aircraft to speed
up. Rapid pitch changes can also affect speed, regardless of whether it is a pitch change in the
horizontal plane or in the vertical plane. Higher pitch rates increase the Angle -of-Attack (AoA), which
increases drag, leading to a loss i n airspeed.
• Speedbrake.  Opening the speedbrake will cause an increase in drag, which can cause a loss of speed,
or reduce the rate the airspeed increases while in a dive.
• Landing Gear.  Lowering the landing gear will produce additional drag like the speedbr ake, b ut they
should only be lowered when below 300 knots  to prevent damage .
The Airspeed & Velocity Scale on the HUD  can be used to monitor airspeed, along with the Airspeed/Mach
Indicator on the center section of the instrument panel.
Changing Altitude
Changing the pitch of the aircraft can increase or decrease the altitude.
• Increase altitude . Pitching the nose up above the horizon will increase altitude, but this will cause a
loss in airspeed unless engine power is increased to compensate. If the aircraft starts to stall, lower
the nose and/or increase engine power.
• Decrease altitude . Pitching  the nose down below the horizon will decrease altitude, but this will cause
an increase in airspeed unless engine power is reduced to compensate. Additionally, the speedbrakes
can be used to maintain current airspeed in shallow dives.
The Barometric Altit ude & Altitude Scale and Radar Altimeter on the HUD can be used to monitor altitude, along
with the Altimeter on the center portion of the instrument panel. Climb/descent rates can be monitored on the
HUD Vertical Velocity Scale, along with the Vertical Ve locity Indicator on the center instrument panel.
Changing Heading
Changing the heading of the aircraft in the horizontal plane is accomplished by rolling, or banking, the aircraft in
the desired direction. As the bank angle is increased, the stick must be pulled back in pitch to prevent a loss in
altitude. At steeper bank angles, pulling back on the stick can increase the turn rate by pitching the nose in the
direction of the turn. Just prior to reaching the desired heading, the stick should be used to roll  the aircraft back
to level flight, so that the aircraft wings return to level just as the desired heading is reached.
Note the following:
• Steep bank angles will require more pitch input to the stick to prevent altitude loss.
• During steep turns, higher pit ch rates will increase the turn rate but will also increase the wings’ angle -
of-attack and cause the aircraft to slow down. If you lose too much speed, the aircraft may become
uncontrollable. Increasing engine power or decreasing the turn rate will prevent  speed loss.  DCS [F/A-18C]

24

 • Keeping the Flight Path Marker on the Horizon Line throughout the turn will prevent altitude loss. A
combination of pitch and roll inputs using the stick can be used to maintain altitude throughout the
turn.
The Magnetic Heading Tape on the HU D can be used to monitor heading, which is displayed on either the top or
bottom of the HUD, depending on the selected master mode. The Steering Cue shows the relative direction to
your steerpoint. If you turn the aircraft to align the Flight Path Marker w ith the Steering Cue, you will be flying
to your steerpoint.
The Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI) also provides the aircraft’s heading. The top of the magnetic
heading compass that is aligned with the lubber line at the top of instrument is  the current heading.

 THE F/A -18C

 AIRCRAFT HISTORY
The McDonnell -Douglas F/A -18 was a groundbreaking aircraft from its very first flight. It holds the honors of
being of the US Navy’s first carrier -based true multirole fighter, the first aircraft with carbon -fiber wings, and the
first fighter aircraft with a fully digital fly -by-wire flight control system. What began as the “loser” of the US Air
Force’s LWF program evolved into a prolific fro nt-line fighter and attack aircraft that served the needs of the
United States and seven other countries for nearly forty years.
The VFAX Programs
In the early 1960s, the US Navy’s principal concern was
the fleet defense mission. The discovery of the Tu -26
“Backfire” by US intelligence caused worry among Navy
admirals that the Soviet Union would soon be capable of
attacking carrier fleets, launching sea -skimming cruise
missiles from well outside the defensible range of the
carrier.
In response to this new threat, the Navy began the VFAX
program, intended to develop a long -range, highly
maneuverable air superiority and fleet defense aircraft.
The program mirrored the US Air Force’s concurrent F -X
program, w hich ultimately resulted in the F -15 Eagle.
VFAX was intended to replace the Navy’s aging fleet of
fighter aircraft, especially the F -111Bs, which were seen
as very lacking in the fleet defense role.
Grumman Aerospace proposed combining its design
experie nce with the F -111B and the A -6 Intruder to produce
a new aircraft, named Design 303. The new aircraft would
be built around a pair of new technologies originally
developed for the F -111B: the powerful AN/AWG -9 radar
and the long -range AIM -54 Phoenix missi le.
The combination of the AWG -9 and AIM -54, placed in a
smaller, more agile airframe, was compelling enough to
convince the Navy to restructure the design requirements of
the VFAX program. The result was t he VFX program, which
ultimately produced the F -14 Tomcat, the Navy’s new
frontline fleet defense and air superiority fighter.
The F -14 enjoyed immediate success as a fleet defense
aircraft, but by the 1970s, it became apparent that it was too expensive an d maintenance -heavy to supplant all
existing Navy fighters. The Secretary of Defense, William H. Clements Jr., ordered the Navy to seek proposals for
a smaller, cheaper alternative to the F -14. Grumman responded with a proposal for the F -14X, a lightweight , less
expensive variant of the F -14. McDonnell -Douglas suggested navalizing the F -15. Both of those were rejected by
Clements.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  27

 At the time, the only two major proponents of the lightweight multirole fighter
concept were VAdm. Kent Lee, commander of Naval  Air Systems Command
(NAVAIR), and VAdm. William Houser, Deputy Chief Naval Officer. Though
Houser and Lee had very different ideas of what a multirole fighter would look
like, they were alone among the Navy brass in believing that the future of the
combat  aircraft was multirole capability.
Lee’s motivations stemmed partially from his experience at sea, where he
estimated that around fifty man -hours of maintenance effort  were being
expended for every one hour an aircraft spends in -flight. When Lee was
selected to serve as NAVAIR’s Commander, he began to advocate for a single
airframe that could replace F -4s, A-7s, and A -4s. Likewise, Houser had become
disillusioned with the existing Navy doctrine during his deployments, seeing
firsthand the difficulty in fly ing and maintaining numerous types of aircraft, each
with their own maintenance practices and parts requirements.
Now that the F -14 had been swept aside as a potential replacement for the
Navy’s fleet of fighter and strike aircraft,  Lee saw an opportunity to realize his
vision. After doggedly advocating his viewpoint to Clements, Clements went along with Lee’s recommendation,
and Lee was given the green light. The Navy then began another VFAX program under Lee’s stewardship, this
time with a greater emphasis on multirole capability.
Lee’s opinions were still unpopular with the other admirals, which made it difficult for Lee to secure Congressional
funding for the new project. Concurrent with the VFAX proposals, the US Air Force had also been looking for a
lightweight fighter (LWF) to complement its expensive F -15s. The House Armed Services Committee, looking to
reduce costs, ordered the Navy and Air Force to combine their efforts. Funding was diverted from VFAX into a
new program, ti tled Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF). NACF would be a new naval aircraft developed from the
contenders already participating in the Air Force’s LWF competition.
The YF -17 “Cobra”
Five defense companies submitted proposals for the LWF
competition, but only  two were selected to participate:
Northrop and General Dynamics. Northrop had already
developed its popular F -5E Tiger II into an internal
project titled N -300. The N -300 added distinctive
leading -edge root extensions (LERX) and more powerful
engines to t he F-5E, among other improvements. The N -
300 evolved into the P -530, which modified the design
of the LERXes, giving the P -530 much improved
maneuverability at high angles of attack. Northrop
selected the P -530 as its LWF contender, slightly
modifying it i nto the P -600. General Dynamics
meanwhile had produced the Model 401, later
designated the YF -16, and both companies were
awarded contracts of approximately $38 million to
develop their proposals into functional prototypes.
International and domestic interest in the LWF program
grew, and with it the stakes of the competition. In
response to the ballooning demand, the USAF merged the LWF program into the new Air Combat Fighter (ACF)
program. The ACF program  solidified the requirement that the LWF contenders be truly multirole aircraft.
VAdm Kent Lee (NHHC)
YF-16 and YF -17 (credit R.L. House)  DCS [F/A-18C]

28

 The YF -16 and YF -17 were tested by the US Air Force in a series of trial flights, and in 1975, the YF -16 was
selected to be the new USAF lightweight fighter. The YF -16 had sup erior acceleration, climb rates, endurance,
and turn rate. Its selection as the winner of the LWF competition secured it numerous procurement orders among
the USAF and NATO allies.
Because the NACF program ran simultaneously with the ACF program, both Gene ral Dynamics and Northrop had
also developed naval variants of their contenders. Neither firm had prior experience developing carrier aircraft.
General Dynamics paired with Vought to develop the Vought Model 1600, a proposal for a strengthened, carrier -
capable F -16; Northrop paired with McDonnell -Douglas to propose the F -18, a carrier -capable YF -17 variant.
Though the YF -16 had won the USAF competition, the Navy wasn’t happy with its single engine and narrow
landing gear. Thus, in 1975, The Navy announced i ts selection of the YF -17, which was to be transformed into a
carrier -based multirole combat aircraft.
Development of the F -18
McDonnell -Douglas and Northrop combined forces to develop the YF -17 into the F -18, then called Model 267.
Both companies agreed to split manufacturing responsibilities evenly: McDonnell -Douglas would build the forward
fuselage, wings, and stabilators; Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage components and the vertical
stabilizers. Final assembly would be at McDonnell -Dougl as.
The F -18 was largely similar in appearance to the YF -17 but underwent many structural and exterior changes to
meet the stringent requirements of a carrier -based aircraft. The entire aircraft was strengthened to withstand the
forces of carrier launch an d recovery, and the undercarriage and tailhook were enlarged and fortified. The wings
and stabilizers were enlarged, and the fuselage widened, and the extra size was used to boost the internal fuel
capacity by 4,460 pounds, sufficient to meet US Navy blue -water reserve requirements. A fully digital fly -by-wire
system with quadruple -redundant flight control computers was added, making the F -18 the first fighter aircraft
with such a control system. Accessories were added to support catapult launches. In all, the modifications brought
the gross weight of the F -18 to 37,000 pounds, a 10,000 -pound increase over the YF -17.
Originally, the F -18 was to be developed in three
variants: An F -18 fighter variant, an A -18 attack variant,
and a TF -18 trainer variant. The F-18 and A -18 variants
would later be combined when improvements in the
avionics and weapons capability of the aircraft allowed a
single variant to perform both roles effectively.
McDonnell -Douglas agr eed to be the prime contractor
for the naval F -18, with Northrop taking ownership of
the proposed land -based F -18L export variant. The F -
18L would never come to fruition, and Northrop and McDonnell -Douglas would end their partnership on bad
terms when expo rt variants of the F -18A drew sales away from the upcoming F -18L. Northrop would later sue
McDonnell -Douglas, claiming that the latter illegally used technologies developed by Northrop for the F -20
Tigershark, a lawsuit that ultimately ended in a settlemen t award of $50 million paid to Northrop. In exchange,
McDonnell -Douglas was free to sell the F -18, both internationally and domestically.
On September 13, 1978, the first production F -18 rolled off the assembly line. Unlike previous aircraft, which
underwe nt flight testing at their place of manufacture, the F -18 was flight -tested at the Naval Air Test Center at
Patuxent River, Maryland. Its first production flight occurred in November 1978, launching from Pax River, and
flown by a US Navy -trained test pilot  instead of a civilian employed by the manufacturer.

 F/A-18A and B Deployment
Following the completion of Navy flight testing, the F -18A
and B models began appearing at fleet replacement
squadrons (FRS) on both coasts. VMFA -314, based at
MCAS El Toro, bec ame the first squadron to receive the F -
18 in January 1983. On April 1, 1984, the Secretary of the
Navy announced that the new aircraft would be
designated the F/A -18, in recognition of its multirole
capability.
The F/A -18 spent a short amount of time grounded prior
to its first deployment, after fatigue cracks began
appearing on the vertical stabilizers. The cracks were
found to be due to the turbulent airflow from the LERXes
that passe d across the stabilizers. The stabilizers were
strengthened and the LERXes were redesigned. Years
later, small fences would be placed atop each LERX, to
divert tip vortices away from the stabilizers. These changes additionally gave the F/A-18 a small boost  in
controllability at high angles of attack.
The F/A-18 saw its first combat deployment between February and August of 1985, aboard the USS Constellation .
Naval aviators were pleased with its reliability in contrast to the F -14. In April 1986, F/A -18s saw  action for the
first time aboard the USS Coral Sea , on deployment off the coast of Libya for Operation Prairie Fire, with VFA -
131, VFA -132, VMFA -314, and VMFA -323 aboard.
The A and B model F/A-18 was also awarded the distinct privilege of being selected a s the eighth aircraft type to
be flown by the US Navy’s Blue Angels, replacing the A -4 Skyhawk in November 1986.
In total, more than 400 F/A -18A and B airframes were produced.
F/A-18C and D Deployment
In 1987, development of the F/A -18C began, commencing w ith Lot 10. The C and D models incorporated
numerous improvements, including upgraded avionics that added the ability for the F/A-18 to employ advanced,
modern weapons such as the AIM -120 AMRAAM, AGM -65 Maverick, and AGM -84 Harpoon. Lot 10 also added the
airborne self -protection jammer (ASPJ) and a ground -mapping synthetic aperture radar.
As with the A and B models, the F/A -18C was the single -seat variant, the D having two seats. The D model could
be configured either as a training variant or as an all -weather strike craft, as used by the Marines.
In 1989, the C and D models were further upgraded with expanded night attack capability by including the
AN/AAR -50 navpod, the AN/AAS -38 forward looking infrared (FLIR), the Litening  II targeting pod, and night vis ion
goggles. 1989 also saw the F/A-18 gain three full -color multipurpose displays, including adding color moving -map
capability to the center AMPCD.

 In 1989, during the first Gulf War, F/A -18 pilots
successfully shot down two MiG -21s during a strike
mission. The pilots were able to switch from the air -
to-ground to air -to-air role, destroy the MiGs within
40 seconds of the E -2C’s initial contact, then s wap
back to air -to-ground and complete their strike,
cementing the credibility of the multirole concept.
(You can play an Instant Action mission inspired by
these events in DCS, if you own the Persian Gulf
map.)
Through the 1990s, US F/A -18Cs and Ds served in
Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring
Freedom while continuing to see further technology
improvements. The F404 -GE-402 turbofan engine
was incorpor ated in 1992, adding 10% more static
thrust. In 1993, F/A-18’s began equipping the
AN/AAS -38A laser target designator/ranger (LTD/R), giving them the ability to target their own laser -guided
munitions. A year later the avionics received another bump, swapping the venerable AN/APG -65 for the powerful
and precise AN/APG -73 attack radar.
Production of the F/A -18C and D ended in August 2000. The last C
model was assembled in Finland for the Finnish Air Force. F/A-18’s
continued to serve the US for the nex t two decades. The C model’s
last cruise was aboard the USS Carl Vinson , which ended in April
of 2018, whereupon the Navy announced that the C models would
be retired from combat duty in February 2019. The aircraft was
honored with a retirement ceremony, b ut a few C -model F/A-18’s
continued to fly in training duty as aggressor aircraft, or in the
service of the Blue Angels. The final flight of an F/A -18C for the US
Navy was on October 2, 2019.
In all, nea rly one thousand C and D model F/A-18’s were produced,
and C models served in the armed forces of eight countries.
Though the United States has retired the C -model F/A-18’s, the
model still serves in the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Finnish Air Force, the  Kuwait Air Force, and the Swiss Air
Force.
The US Navy has since replaced its carrier fighter fleet with the F/A -18E and F models , representing a major leap
forward in the F/A-18’s capability and lethality on the battlefield. Though the E and F models sha re the name and
same basic appearance as the C and D models, they are a completely different design, with enlarged fuselage
and wings, an entirely new avionics suite and cockpit, upgraded engines, and many other improvements.
There are three US Navy F/A -18C’s on display in the US, with more coming as the Blue Angels transition to the
F/A-18E and F models:
• BuNo 163106, painted in Blue Angels #2 livery, is at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA
• BuNo 163439, painted in Blue Angels #1 livery, is at the Smithson ian Air and Space Museum in

 WEAPONS & MUNITIONS
M61A1 Vulcan 20mm Cannon
The F /A-18C is equipped with an M61 Vulcan internal cannon. The  M61 fires standard M50 20mm rounds at 6, 000
rounds per minute. It is effective against both surface and air targets. The ammunition drum carries 510 rounds.
The M61 in DCS can be loaded with a mix of live rounds and tracers, or with live rounds only.
AIM-9 Sidewinder
The AIM -9 Sidewinder is an infrared -guided (heat -seeking) short -range air -to-
air missile. It first entered service in 1956 and has since become one of the
most successful missiles in the West. Its longevity is thanks to its versatility and
continued improvement over multiple generations.
The AIM -9 uses an array of up to five scanning infrared sensors, cooled by an
internal argon bottle (L and M models). The Sidewinder has a maximum speed
of over Mach 2.5 and a maximum range of around 10 to 20 miles, depending
on the variant. Minimum range is around 3,000 feet.
The AIM -9 can be mounted directly to an LAU -127 on the wingtips, or up to
two Sidewinders can be mounted to an LAU -127 mated with an LAU -115C, which adapt s to the BRU -32 ejector
rack, allowing the missile to be mounted to the underwing pylons.
AIM-9L Sidewinder.  The 1977 “Lima” model was the first all -aspect Sidewinder, meaning it no longer required
the target to present a rear profile. The AIM -9L earned it s first kill when it struck a Libyan Su -22, after being fired
from an F -14 Tomcat, in the infamous Gulf of Sidra engagement of 1981.
AIM-9M Sidewinder.  The 1982 “Mike” model improved on the Guidance Control Section (GCS). Susceptibility
to flares was reduc ed, and background discrimination was improved, resulting in a greater chance of lock -on.
The motor ’s smoke signature was reduced, making the missile less likely to be detected.
AIM-9X Sidewinder.  The 2003 “X-ray” model is the latest iteration of the Sidew inder. The X -ray adds high off -
boresight (HOBS) capability and the ability to slave the seeker head to the JHMCS. The missile ’s maneuverability
was boosted with all -axis thrust -vectoring capability. These changes allow the pilot to simply “point their head
and shoot ” in nearly any direction, and the missile will make its way to the target. The infrared sensor was
replaced with focal -plane arrays (FPAs) and counter -countermeasures capability was improved further. Electronic
fuzing was added to reduce minimum  range.
CAP-9M. Captive variant of the AIM -9M. The captive variant has the same size, weight, and drag characteristics
as the AIM -9M, for training effectiveness. It also contains an integrated infrared sensor and will provide audio
and visual guidance cues  to the pilot, but it does not have a motor and does not release from the aircraft.

 AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM -120 AMRAAM is an active radar homing (ARH) medium -
range air -to-air missile. First introduced in 1982, the AMRAAM was
intended to replace the semi -active radar homing AIM -7 Sparrow,
which was the medium -range BVR missile in the US inventory at the
time.
The AIM -120 uses both command guidance and radar homing to
reach its target. The AIM -120’s integral radar has a comparatively
short r ange, and so until the missile is within that range, it is guided
by datalink commands sent automatically from the launching
aircraft. The AMRAAM has a maximum speed around Mach 4 and a
maximum range of 30 to 40 miles.
The AIM -120 is mounted to the LAU -127, which can be mounted in
singles or pairs to LAU -115C, allowing the missile to be mounted to the underwing pylons. It can also be mounted
directly to stations 4 and 6.
AIM-120B AMRAAM. This 1994 variant is the earliest variant still in production.
AIM-120C AMRAAM. The 1996 variant improved target detection, homing capability, and fuzing.
AIM-7 Sparrow
The AIM -7 Sparrow is a semi -active medium -range air -to-air missile.
Development on the Sparrow first began in 1949, when it was originally
conceived as a beamrider. The AAM -N-2 Sparrow I, this beam -rider variant,
entered service in 1954. Later prototypes were active radar -guided, but the
first Sparrow to enter widespread production was the AAM -N-6 Sparrow III
(later renamed the  AIM-7C). The AIM -7E saw extensive use in Vietnam,
where 612 were fired, resulting in 56 kills.
The modern AIM -7 has a maximum speed of Mach 4 and an operational range of up to 53 nautical miles, though
performance will depend on the intensity of the radar  energy reflected from the target. As a semi -active guided
missile, the launching aircraft must maintain a continuous radar lock on the target until impact.
The AIM -7 is mounted to the LAU -115C connected to underwing pylons.
AIM-7F Sparrow. The 1976 varian t had improved range thanks to a dual -stage rocket motor, solid -state
electronics, and a larger warhead than the E model.
AIM-7M Sparrow. The most common variant today, the M was first introduced in 1982 and used extensively
during the First Gulf War. Trac king reliability was greatly improved with the use of an inverse monopulse radar.
It also added active -radar proximity fuzing, better ECCM, and better performance at low altitudes.
AIM-7MH Sparrow.  This is the AIM -7M variant with a newer software version ( the H build). The upgraded
software improves guidance and loft performance.

 AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)
The AGM -154 is the result of a combined Navy/Air Force
venture to produce a precision -guided glide bomb, first
introduced in 1988 and first em ployed during Operation
Desert Fox. The AGM -154 uses an INS/GPS guidance
system to navigate to its target. The bomb is unpowered,
but the extending glide fins give it a range of around 70
nautical miles when dropped from high altitudes. The
bomb weighs aro und 1,000 pounds.
The AGM -154 development program is widely considered
to be one of the best successes in project management
in the defense industry. The program is often used as an
example in the industry and in academia.
AGM -154A. The baseline JSOW has a warhead containing 145 BLU -97/B combined effects submunitions. The
submunitions have anti -armor, anti -materiel, and anti -personnel effects. The AGM -154A is typically used as a
SEAD weapon.
AGM -154C. The unitary v ariant contains an infrared seeker used during the terminal phase and the penetrating
BROACH warhead. The BROACH warhead is a two -stage system designed for penetrating hardened bunkers. It
consists of the WDU -44 shaped augmenting warhead and the WDU -45 fol low-through bomb. The WDU -44
penetrates the armor layer, and the WDU -45 detonates within the interior chambers, amplifying its concussive
effects.
AGM-84 Harpoon , SLAM, and SLAM -ER
The AGM -84D Harpoon is a turbojet -powered sea -skimming
anti-ship missile with over -the-horizon attack capability. The
Harpoon uses INS mid -course guidance, then locates and guides
to its target using terminal attack radar. It then performs a
terminal pop -up maneuver just prio r to impact. The missile sea -
skims at around Mach 0.7 and contains a 500 -pound warhead
with impact fuzing. The missile weighs 1,500 pounds.
The AGM -84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) is a land
attack variant developed from the Harpoon. The SLAM enhances
the INS midcourse guidance with GPS updates, adds infrared -
homing terminal guidance and the capability for datalinked
seeker head video and datalinked command guidance, and
increases the warhead si ze to 1,000 pounds.
Both variants have a range more than 60 nautical miles.
The AGM -84K SLAM Extended Response (SLAM -ER) is an improvement over the SLAM that greatly improves its
range to around 150 nautical miles and adds improved terminal guidance capabi lities.

 AGM-88 HARM
The AGM -88 High -speed Anti -Radiation Missile (HARM) is a passive
radar homing air -to-ground missile used in the suppression of
enemy air defenses (SEAD) role. The HARM has a radar receiver
and processor that detects and identifies sig nals from enemy
surface radars. When launched, it can guide to the target by homing
on its specific radar emissions. The missile also has an inertial
guidance system to provide mid -course guidance prior to detection
of the radar signal (or if the signal is  lost).
The AGM -88 has a maximum speed of Mach 1.84 and an operational
range of around 80 nautical miles. It uses a laser proximity fuze for
detonation.
AGM -88C. This mid -1980s variant incorporates field -reprogrammable software  and improved guidance and
fuzing.
AGM-65 Maverick
The AGM -65 Maverick is a medium -range air -to-ground missile
designed for the close air support role. The AGM -65 family contains
a diverse set of variants and guidance systems, including infrared,
electro -optical, and laser guidance.
The AGM -65 has a maximum range of around 13 nautical miles. It
was first delivered in 1972. A single Maverick can be mounted to an
LAU-117 rack.
AGM -65E Maverick.  The E model uses laser guidance,  either from
the F/A-18C’s onboard  designator  or from another laser emitter. It
has a 300 -lb penetrating warhead with a delayed fuze.
AGM -65F Maverick.  The F model uses an infrared tracking system adapted for the anti -ship role. It has the
same warhead as the Maverick E.
AGM-62 Walleye II
The AGM -62 Walleye II is a television -guided glide bomb dating back
to 1963 and used principally during the Vietnam War. The original
AGM-62 models used image centroid tracking like electro -optical
Mavericks; newer models also added datalinked video and co mmand
guidance capability.
The AGM -62 has a 2,000 -lb high -explosive warhead. Despite being
designated “AGM,” the AGM -62 is an unpowered glide bomb.

247 Mk. 118 Mo d 1 bomblets. Each bomblet contains a shaped
charge capable of penetrating several inches of armor. Rockeyes
were used extensively during Operation Desert Storm to attrit
Iraqi tank battalions. The Mk. 20 and CBU -99 are unguided free -
fall bombs.
Mk. 20 Roc keye.  The baseline variant is used for shore -based
operations.
CBU-99. This variant has increased thermal protection and is
used for shipboard operations.
The Rockeye can be mounted in pairs on a BRU -33 rack.
Paveway II Laser Guided Bomb
The Paveway II is a series of laser -guided bombs based on conventional
general -purpose bombs. The guidance kit consists of a laser detector and
processor in the front and a set of steering fins in the back. The bomb
detects and tracks reflected laser energy off a target. The laser
designation can come from the launching aircraft, another aircraft
(“buddy lasing”), or from a laser -capable ground unit such as a JTAC.
The Paveway II series  was introduced in the early 1970s to replace the
first-generation Paveway series of laser -guided bombs. The Paveway II
improved sensor reliability and added extendible rear fins to extend glide
range. The Paveway II series uses “bang -bang” control (where the fins
can only deflect fully in either direction), limiting its maximum range and forcing it to follow a sinusoidal path to
the target.

 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)
JDAM is a kit that modifies a Mk. 80 -series conventional bomb,
giving it precision INS/GPS guidance capability. The JDAM kit
consists of a GPS receiver, integral INS, and steerable fins. JDAM
bombs must downlink target coordinates prior to release and
cannot be manually steered or re -targeted after release. Modern
JDAM kits have a precision of around 25 feet circular error
probable (CEP).
The Joint Direct Attack Munition program began after Operation
Desert Storm, when the US Air Force sought a weapon that could
guide more reliably than an LGB in adverse weather such as dust
storms. After extensive testing, the concept  of an INS/GPS -guided
bomb was shown to be effective by 1993, and the first JDAM kits
were delivered to operational squadrons in 1997.

• A/A: Air -to-Air
• X: X Band
• Y: Y Band
Now you can actuate the ON/OFF selector pushbutton to turn the TACAN system on. The TACAN channel number
may be changed using the UFC keypad. In the T/R mode the TACAN computes bearing, and measures slant
range from t he selected TACAN station. In the RCV mode only bearing from the selected TACAN station is
computed. In the A/A mode, interrogations and replies are only single pulse from one aircraft to another. TACAN
with bearing and range information is plotted on the HSI. When TACAN is boxed on the HSI, range information
is displayed on the HSI and HUD. With a course line selected and in NAV mode, steering information is displayed
on the HUD and the distance course line is displayed in the lower right corner of the HSI  with a C beside it. For
example: 15 miles from course line would be displayed as “15 C”. This is very useful on the downwind leg of a
carrier landing pattern by selecting the carrier TACAN, set the carrier course line, and then fly 1.2 miles abeam
of the course line on the downwind leg parallel to the course line until starting the 180° turn.

 Advanced Multipurpose Color Display (AMPCD)
The AMPCD (generally referred to as just the MPCD)  is a full-color, NVG compatible digital display capable of
providing any MENU selectable format except the A/G radar display. The MPCD is dr iven by either the Digital Map
Set (DMS) for HSI displays, or the left DDI for all other MENU selectable formats. Four momentary two -position
rocker switches and a rotary knob, located on the front of the MPCD, permit control of MPCD off/brightness,
night/ day viewing modes, symbology, gain, and contrast.

Figure 9. MPCD
1. Off/Brightness Control . This rotary switch powers  on the AMPCD when it is rotated out of the OFF
position. When DAY is selected on the night/day brightness selector, AMPCD brightness is controlled
using this rotary. When NGT is selected, brightness is controlled automatically . (Brightness is always
controlled automatically when the HSI format is shown on the AMPCD.)
2. Night/Day Brightness Selector . This rocker switch toggles between auto and manual brightness
control. When DAY is pressed, AMPCD brightness can be adjusted using the brightness knob to the

Standby Attitude Reference Indicator (SARI)
This is a self-contained instrument to indicate aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw.

Figure 12. SARI
[F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  55

 The standby attitude reference indicator (SARI) is a self -contained electrically driven gyro -horizon type instrument
An OFF flag appears if both  power sources fail, or if the gyro is caged. During caging the gyro initially cages to
4° pitch and 0° roll regardless of aircraft attitude. Cagi ng when the aircraft is in a roll attitude greater than 5°
cuts out the roll erection system and the gyro does not erect properly. After 3 to 5 minutes, the indicator reads
0° in pitch and 0° in roll. Both readings assume the aircraft is straight and level. Pitch display is limited by
mechanical stops at approximately 90° climb and 80° dive. As the aircraft re aches a near vertical orientation, the
roll display experiences large rotations. An aircraft wings level attitude in the vertical orientation may result in
large errors in either pitch or roll, or both. This is normal and is not an indication of damage or improper function
of the indicator. After completion of vertical maneuvers, the indicator most likely requires caging in the normal
cruise attitude, to eliminate the errors. Vertical maneuvers with a wing down condition of 7° or more usually do
not develop  significant gyro errors. A needle and ball are at the bottom of the instrument. A one -needle width
turn is 90° per minute.
Turn the knob at the bottom right to set the zero -pitch index. Pull the knob to cage the attitude indicator.
Azimuth Indicator
Also referred to as the Radar  Warning Receiver  (RWR), this is discussed in the Defensive Systems section of this

The standby airspeed indicator displays  airspeed from 60 to 850 knots indicated airspeed. It operates directly off
left pitot pressure and left static pressure with N ORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static
pressure with BACKUP selected.
Standby Altimeter
Indication of aircraft barometric altitude.  The standby altimeter is a counter -pointer t ype. The counter drum
indicates altitude in thousands of feet from 00 to 99. The long pointer indicates altitude in 50 -foot increments
with one full revolution each 1,000 feet. A knob and window permit setting the altimeter to the desired barometric
settin g. This setting is also used by the air data computer. The standby altimeter operates directly off the left
static pressure with NORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static pressure with BACKUP
selected.
Standby Vertical Velocity In dicator
Indication of  aircraft positive or negative change of altitude rate.
HMD Control
Rotating the HMD knob clockwise activates the Helmet Mounted  Sight and adjusts brightness. Please see the
Helmet Mounted Display (HMD)  chapter.
Spin Recovery
This control is a hold -over from earlier production lots of the F/A-18C. During later development of the F/A-18C’s
flight control system, this switch and system was rendered obs olete. In fact, in official F/A-18C flight manuals, it
is prohibited from use. Although we have fully -modeled this system for complete accuracy, it should not be used.  DCS [F/A-18C]

 The spin recovery system, when engaged, puts the flight controls in a spin recovery mode  (SRM). This mode,
unlike CAS, gives the pilot full aileron, rudder and stabilator authority without any control surface interconnects
and all rate and acceleration feedbacks are removed. The leading -edge flaps are driven to 33° ±1° down and the
trailing e dge flaps are driven to 0° ±1°.
• NORM. Spin recovery mode engaged when all the following conditions are met:
o Airspeed 120 ±15 knots.
o Sustained, un -commanded yaw rate.
o Stick is placed in the direction indicated on the DDI spin recovery display.
o The flight controls revert to CAS anytime the stick is placed in the wrong direction (i.e.,
pro-spin), the airspeed increases above about 245 knots, or the yaw rate decreases to less
than 15°/second.
• RCVY. Spin mode engaged when airspeed is 120 ±15 knots. The flight controls revert to CAS when
the airspeed increases  above about 245 knots. Full authority pro-spin controls can be applied with
the switch in RCVY, and spin mode engaged.

Canopy Jettison Handle
The black and yellow striped canopy jettison handle  is on the left inboard canopy sill just aft of the instrument
panel. Pulling the handle aft activates the canopy jettison system.
Landing Gear Handle  [G]
The landing gear is controlled by a two -position, wheel -shaped handle on the lower left side of the main
instrument panel. Two conditions must be met before the gear can be raised: the aircraft must sense that weight
is off all three -landing gear and the launch bar must be retracted . When these con ditions are met, the landing
gear is raised by moving the handle up. If the launch bar is extended when the handle is raised, the main gear
retracts but the nose gear remains extended. When the aircraft senses weight on any of the three -landing gear,
a mec hanical stop in the landing gear control panel extends preventing movement of the handle from DN to UP.
Moving the handle down lowers the gear.
The landing gear warning light is a red light in the gear handle. The light comes on when the gear is in transit
and remains on until all three gear are down and locked when DN is selected, or all the gear doors are closed
when UP is selected. The light remains on with the gear down and locked if the left or right main landing gear
link is not locked. When the landi ng gear handle light has been on for 15 seconds the landing gear aural tone
also comes on.
Emergency gear extension is done by rotating the gear handle 90° clockwise and pulling to the detent where the
handle locks in place  (in the sim, this is done with t he mousewheel) . This can be done with the handle in either
UP or DN; however, the handle must be rotated 90° before it is pulled. Rotating and pulling the gear handle

 opens the valves for the emergency landing gear control, the APU accumulator and the emer gency brake
accumulator. The nose landing gear extends by free fall aided by air  loads, and the main landing gear extends
by free fall aided by the side brace down  lock actuator and the compressed shock absorber. If gear indicates
unsafe following emergenc y extension, it may be the result of the APU accumulator arming valve not opening .
Launch Bar S witch
The launch bar is hydraulically extended and retracted by redundant springs. A locking tab mechanically locks
the launch bar in the up position. The two position (EXTEND and RETRACT) launch bar switch controls launch
bar operation. As the launch  bar extend s the green L BAR advisory light comes on. When the launch bar is fully
extended it is held against the deck by load control springs. The control springs allow vertical movement of the
launch bar during taxi. As the aircraft is taxied into the launch gear the launch bar drops over the shuttle and is
held captive in the extended position as the shuttle is tensioned. The green L BAR advisory light goes out when
the switch is placed to RETRACT. If the red L BAR warning light is on with the switch in RETRACT, a n electrical
fault exists which prevents launch bar retraction after launch. At the completion of the catapult stroke, launch
bar/catapult separation occurs and the return springs cause launch bar retraction which allows the landing gear
to be retracted. I f the launch bar fails to retract after the aircraft is launched, the red L BAR warning light comes
on and the nosewheel  does not retract. A launch bar circuit breaker is on the left essential circuit breaker panel
and when pulled de -energizes the launch b ar electrical system.
Flap Switch
The FLAP switch selects which of the two flight control computer modes (auto flap up or takeoff and land) is
active and thus determines the flight characteristics for those conditions.
• AUTO . Without Weight on Wheels  (WOW),  leading and trailing edge flaps are scheduled as a
function of AoA. With WOW, leading and trailing edge flaps and aileron droop are set to  0°. [F]
• HALF. Below 250 knots, leading edge flaps are scheduled as a function  of AoA. Trailing edge flaps
and ailero n droop are scheduled as a function of airspeed to a maximum of 30° at approach
airspeeds. Above 250 knots, the flaps operate in the auto flap up mode and the amber FLAPS light
comes on. On the ground, the leading -edge flaps are set to 12°. The trailing ed ge flaps and aileron
droop are set to 30°. With the wing unlocked, aileron droop is set to 0 °. [LShift] + [F]
• FULL. Below 250 knots, leading edge flaps are scheduled as a function of AoA. Trailing edge flaps
and aileron droop are scheduled as a function of  airspeed to a maximum of 45° flaps and 42° aileron
droop at approach airspeeds. Above 250 knots, the flaps operate in the auto flaps up mode and the
amber FLAPS light comes on. On the ground, the leading -edge flaps are set to 12°. The trailing edge
flaps are set to 43° to 45° and aileron droop to 42°. With the wings unlocked, aileron droop is set to
0°. [LCtrl] + [F]
Selective Jettison Kn ob
The selective jettison knob on the left vertical panel has rotary positions L FUS MSL, SAFE, R FUS MSL,
RACK/LCHR, and STORES. L FU S MSL and R FUS MSL selects the required fuselage missile for jettison. The
RACK/LC HR and STORES positions select what is to be jettisoned from the weapon stations selected by the station
jettison select buttons. The JETT center pushbutton activates the jettison circuits provided the landing gear is up
and locked and the master arm switch is in ARM. The SAFE position prevents any selective jettison.  DCS [F/A-18C]

 Landing / Taxi Li ght
This is a combination landing and taxi light located  on the n ose gear strut. The light is controlled by the LDG/TAXI
light switch on the left vertical panel.
• OFF. Light is off.
• ON. If the  landing gear handle is in DN and the landing gear is down, the light is on.
Anti-Skid Swi tch
The anti -skid circuit prevents brake application  on landing until wheel speed is over 50 knots, or if a wet runway
delays wheel spin -up, 3 second s after touchdown. A locked wheel protect ion circuit releases the brakes if the
speed of one main wheel is 40% of the other main wheel. The locked wheel protection circuit is disabled at about
35 knots. The anti -skid system is totally disabled below 10 knots. Anti -skid is used for airfield operation, but not
for carrier operations.
Emergency / Parking Brake Handle
The combination emergency/parking brake handle is on the lower left corner of the main instrument panel. The
handle is shaped such that EMERG is visible to the pilot when the handle is in the stowed or emergency position
and PARK is visible to the pilot wh en the handle is rotated to the park position.
The parking brake system uses the same hydraulic lines, accumulators , and actuation handle as the emergency
brake system. The system is activated by rotating the emergency/parking brake handle 90° counterclock wise
from the horizontal stowed position and pulling it out to a positive locked position. If the emergency brakes have
been activated, it is necessary to reposition the handle to the stowed position then rotate it 90° counterclockwise
and pull it to the l ocked position to select parking brakes. This action applies non -regulated pressure to the disc
brakes. With the INS on, the parking brake set, and both throttles above about 80% rpm, the PARK BRK caution
and MASTER CAUTION come on. To release the parking brake, rotate the emergency/ parking brake handle 45°
counterclockwise from the extended position. This releases the lock and allows the handle to return to the
horizontal stowed position.
Brake Accumulator Pressure G auge
Brake accumulator pressure i s show n on a pressure  gauge on the lower left corner of the main instru ment panel
and is redlined to indicate pressure below 2,000 psi. 3,000 psi is a normal level.
Arrestor Hook Bypass S witch
With this switch set to the CARRI ER position, the AoA I ndexer Lights will light solid when the arrestor  hook and
landing gear are down and locked. It will however flash if the arrestor hook is up. When set to FIELD, the AoA
Indexer Lights will stay solid when the arrestor hook is not down.  Lowering the arresting hook will r elease a
solenoid and move the switch to the CARRIER position.

Three lighting controls c omprise this panel:
• Position Lights . The position lights include a white light just below the tip of the right vertical tail
fin, three green lights on the right side of the aircraft, and three red lights on the left side of the
aircraft.  The position lights are controlled by the POSITION lights knob. The exterior lights master
switch must be ON for the position lights knob to operate.
• Formation Lights . Eight formation lights are provided. Two lights are on each wing tip, two lights
are on  the outboard of the vertical tail fins, two lights are on the aft fuselage below the vertical tail
fins, and two lights are on either side of the forward fuselage just forward of the LEX. The formation
lights are controlled by the FORMATION lights control  knob on the exterior lights panel which
provides variable lighting between positions OFF and BRT. The exterior lights master switch must be
ON for the formation lights knob to operate.
• Strobe Lights . Two red anti -collision strobe lights, one on each outbo ard vertical tail fin, are
provided. The strobe lights are controlled by the STROBE lights switch on the exterior lights panel.
The exterior lights master switch must be ON for the strobe lights switch to be operative.
o OFF Lights are off.
o BRT Lights illumi nate at full intensity.
o DIM Lights illuminate  at reduced intensity.
APU and Engine Crank P anel
The APU switch is a two -position switch with positions of ON and OFF. OFF Provides a manual shutdown for the
APU. ON Starts the start cycle of the APU. Switch is electrically held in the ON position and automatically returns
to OFF 1 minute after the secon d generator comes  on the line.
The APU is a small aircraft mounted gas turbine engine used to  generate a source of air to power  the air turbine
starter(s) . It is situated on the underside of the fuselage between the engines, with both intake and  exhaust
facing downwards. A hydraulic motor powered by the APU accumulator, normally charged by  HYD 2B, is used to
start the APU. A hand pump may be used to charge the accumulator. The aircraft  battery provides electrical
power for the APU ignition and start control  circuits. The APU uses aircraft  fuel.
Operation of the APU is automatic after the APU switch, on the left console, is placed to ON. The  APU may be
shut down at any time by placing the APU switch to OFF. After the APU has completed  its start cycle a green
READY light comes on. After the second generator is online , the APU runs  approximately 1 minute then the APU
switch returns to OFF.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  63

 Either engine may be started first; however, starting the right engine first provides normal hydraulic pressure to
the brake s. After the APU READY light is on, place  the electrically held engine crank switch to R. This opens the
right air turbine starter control valve .
(ATSCV) and APU air powers the ATS. The ATS in turn cranks the right engine by way of the AMAD  gearbox and
power transmission shaft. After the right generator comes online  the engine crank  switch automatically returns
to OFF. The left engine is started the same way as the right. One minute  after the second generator comes online
the APU shuts down.
Flight Control System (FCS) P anel
Movement of the rudder trim knob on the FCS control panel  electrically biases the flight control computers. The
rudder pedals do not move.
The T/O trim button is in the center of the rudder trim knob on the  FCS panel. With WOW, holding t he button
down  drives the roll and yaw trim to the neutral position,  stabilator 12° nose  up, and zeros the mechanical stick
position. When the roll and yaw control surfaces are trimmed to neutral and the stabilator to  12° nose up, the
TRIM advisory is displayed on the DDI until the button is released. In flight, pressing the T/O trim button only
neutralizes the mechanical  stick position.

while the threat is detected.
FCS Voice Alerts. Any FCS caution except CHECK TRIM, FCS, NWS, FC AIR DAT, g-LIM OVRD, or R -LIM OFF is
accompanied by a “flight controls, “flight controls ” voice alert. An engine fire would be result in “Engine Fire Left”
and/or “Engine Fire Right”. An APU fire woul d result in “APU Fire”. A bleed air failure will result in either a “Bleed
Air Left” and/or “Bleed Air Right”.

All voice alerts are repeated twice ( e.g., “Engine Fire Left, Engine Fire Left ”)
Primary Radar Low Altitude Warning. If the landing gear is up and lo cked and the radar  altitude is less than
the Low Altitude Limit index, the primary low altitude warning tone/voice alert  is heard in the pilot ’s headset. A
“whoop whoop”  warning  tone is heard. The voice alert or warning tone is activated at ground power -up to
familiarize the pilot  with the warning. When  first activated in flight, the warning is continuously repeated until
reset or disabled. The warning is reset by setting the low altitude index to an altitude below the present altitude
or by climbin g to an altitude above the low altitude index setting. The warning can be disabled by  pressing the
RALT button on the UFC or by commanding the UFC to another mode. Once disabled  it cannot be triggered until
after being reset as described above.
With an MC1  failure, the voice alert/warning tone is not sounded when  the aircraft descends below the altitude
set by the low altitude index  pointer.
With landing gear down, the radar altimeter warning sounds once when the aircraft descends through the set
altitude.

 CONTROL STICK  & THROTTLES
Control Stick
The stick contains the pitch and roll trim switch, sensor control switch, Air -to-Ground bomb release button,
gun/forward -firing weapons trigger, Air -to-Air weapon select switch, undesignate /nosewheel  steering button. An
autopilot/ nosewheel  steering disengage switch (paddle switch) is mounted below the stick grip. Stick position
sensors transmit an electrical signal proportional to  stick displacement from neutral to the flight control
computers.
Several of the switches have multiple functions that depend on a selected mode. We will discuss those in the
later, relevant sections of this manual.

 If the nosewheel steering system fails, NWS and FCS are displayed on the DDI as cautions, the MASTER
CAUTION light comes on, and the NWS or NWS HI di splay is removed from the HUD. When failed, the
nosewheel steering system reverts to a free swiveling mode.
Undesignate . When  not in a nose -wheel steering state (weight off wheels), this button is used to
undesignate  a previously designated target or location. This commands radar return to search and
undesignate s targets.

Nosewheel steering disengage  [A]. This paddle switch has  multiple functions depending on the state of the
aircraft. Functions include:
• Nosewheel  Steering . Disengages commanded nosewheel  steering . If the high mode is desired
during taxi, press and hold the nosewheel  steering button. If the wings are folded and N WS is
engaged, high gain mode is entered by pressing and releasing the NWS button.
• Autopilot Disengage . Disengage the commanded autopilot  mode and return to manually controlled
flight.
• G Limiter Override . The g limiter may be overridden by momentarily pres sing the paddle switch
with the control stick near full aft. Command limit g is then increased by 33%. A g-LIM OVRD caution
is displayed , and the MASTER CAUTION light and tone come on. Override is disengaged when the
control stick is returned to near neutr al.
Pitch and roll trim switch . Normally, movement of the pitch ([RCtrl]  + [.] and [RCtrl]  + [;]) and  roll
([RCtrl]  + [,] and [RCtrl]  + [/]) trim switch electrically biases the flight controls  and the stick does not move
(unlike the A -10C and Black Shark). Little if any pitch trim is required in the AUTO flap mode due to the automatic
trimming functions within the flight control computers. Only in landing configuration will manual  pitch trim be
required. If there is asymmetric loading, roll trim will be required. In MECH, pitch trim moves the control stick
fore and aft, changing the stick neutral point. There is no mechanical lateral trim.
Trim changes the tracked g loading up to 25 ° AoA. It is normally 1 g. Disengaging the autopilot in a level 2 g,
60° bank angle turn will leave the stick trimmed for 2 g. This then requires significant stick force to hold the nose
down while in level flight. Re -engaging either Altitude Hold or Attitude Hold with  wings level should reset the trim
back to 1 g. To better support game play, it is suggested that the aircraft return to 1 g when AP is disengaged
under all conditions.
If flaps are down, pitch trim functions like other trim switches, holding the trim swit ch results in continuous linear
changes until the switch is released. Trim input with flaps down sets the flight control computers to target an
angle of attack. With flaps up, trim inputs more than one second are ignored. Trim inputs with flaps up results in
changes to tracked g.

Recce event mark [R]. In the early access, this can be used to blank the helmet mounted display when pressed.

Weapon select switch . Four position switch which selects A/A weapon in A/A aircraft master mode. Switch
functions are d iscrete inputs.
• Forward [LShift ] + [W]: Activates AIM -7, displays the priority missile. Commands a radar antenna
four bar elevation, 140° azimuth scan, 40 -mile range selection, and interleaved PRF.
• Center Push [LShift ] + [S]: Activates AIM -9 and displays the priority missile. Command s a radar
antenna four bar elevation, 80° azimuth scan, 40-mile range selection for AIM -9L, AIM-9M and AIM-
9X, and interleaved PRF. DCS [F/A-18C]

 • Aft [LShift ] + [X]: Activates gun and displays gun. Commands GACQ to the radar system, a range
of 5nmi, radar antenna a zimuth scan of five bars, with 20° elevation scan (vertical scan). Configures
sensor control switch to the ACM condition.
• Right [LShift ] + [D]: Activates AIM -120 and displays priority missile. Commands a radar antenn a
two-bar elevation, 80° azimuth scan, 40-mile range selection for AIM -120B/ C, and interleaved PRF.
Note : If a target is tracked as the L&S, the weapon select switch should only change the weapon and not affect
radar operation based on weapon selection.
Sensor control switch (4 position) . This is a four position, momentary, centering switch. Switch functions
are discrete inputs.
• Forward [RAlt ] + [;]: When in NAV or A/G  mode, this assigns  throttle designator control (TDC)
priority to Head -Up Display (HUD). When in A/A mode, this also places the HUD in the ACM sub -
mode and radar in boresight .
• Aft [RAlt ] + [.]: When in A/G mode, this assigns  TDC priority to Advanced Multipurpose Color
Displa y (AMPCD). When in A/A mode, this assigns the TDC to the AMPCD SA page. If in an A/A ACM
sub-mode, this puts radar in vertical acquisition (VACQ). If in NAV mode, this toggles the AMPCD
between the HS I and SA formats .
• Left [LAlt ] + [,]: Assigns TDC priorit y to the LDDI. If TDC priority is already assigned to the LDDI
and LDDI is radar display, commands radar to track mode STT when TDC is over a radar return. If
radar is tracking, commands break lock (not undesignate ). In A/A ACM sub -mode, commands wide
acquisition (WACQ) to radar system. If TGP FLIR is displayed on the LDDI, it will command a track in
either A/A or A/G.
• Right [RAlt ] + [/]: Assigns TDC priority to the RDDI. If TDC priority is already assigned to the
RDDI and RDDI is radar display, commands ra dar to track mode STT when TDC is over a radar
return. If TGP FLIR is displayed  on the RDDI, it will command a track in either A/A or A/G.
Note:  All ACM modes will automatically lock a target.

 Throttles
The throttle grips contain switches that provide va rious systems control without moving the hand from the
throttles. As with the control stick, the HOTAS functions of the throttles vary in functionality depending on the
state and operational modes of the aircraft. These are discussed in the appropriate sections of this document.

Figure 21. Throttles
Dispense Switch, AFT  - OFF - FWD . This three -way switch allows manual and semi -automatic use of the ALE -

• Aft [D]. Activates the countermeasures program selected on the EW page.
When the Dispenser selector knob is in BYPASS, the switch has an alternate function:
• Forward  [E]. Dispenses a single chaff .
• Center . No function.
• Aft [D]. Dispenses a single flare .

 automatically retracts above 6.0 g or  above 28° AOA and, when not in the auto flaps up mode, below 250 knots.
The speedbrake will automatically retract if flaps are extended unless the speedbrake switch is held aft. T he
speedbrake extends with the flaps HALF or FULL so long as the switch is held in EXTEND.  The speedbrake can
be commanded to extend to any intermediate position but will retract fully with a momentary forward press of
the speedbrake switch. The spee dbrake operates normally on the ground.
With flaps extended and weight on wheels  (after landing or during an abort for example), the speed brake
remains extended without holding the speed brake switch aft.
• Aft [LShift ] + [B]. Extends the speed brake while the switch is held aft. Spring -loaded to center
detent.
• Forward  [LCtrl ] + [B]. Retracts the speed brake or maintains the speed brake retracted and
prevents creep.
• Center  [B]. Speedbrake will creep closed if open when speed is greater than 400 kts.

CAGE/UNCAGE button  [C]. This switch has multiple functions that depend on the active sy stem or weapon.
• NAV Mode . Used to cage or uncage the velocity vector on the HUD.
• A/A Mode, AIM -9. Controls Sidewinder  seeker position. AIM-9 seeker head is boresighted until L&S
designation, then it is slaved to the L&S. Pressing the cage button with an L& S, toggles the seeker
head between the L&S and boresight. Pressing and holding the cage button with the AIM -9 seeker
head in boresight, then maneuvering the aircraft to point at a target heat source, achieving AIM -9
tone rise, then releasing the cage butto n will result in  AIM-9 seeker head tracking the heat source to
the gimbals of the missile.
• A/A Mode, AIM -7. In A/A mode with Sparrow missile selected, commands radar into STT on the
L&S target.
• A/G Mode, Maverick . Cages the Maverick to boresight, or uncage s it and allows it to slew .
Throttle Designator Controller (TDC) . Upon setting TDC to one of the displays, the TDC acts as a slew control
to move the cursor / sensor. Controls are u p [;], down [.], left [,], right [/], and depress [Enter] .
• Not pressed, with left or right force applied:  Positions acquisition symbol left or right at rate
proportional to pressure applied to control.
• Not pressed with up or down force applied:  Positions acquisition symbol up or down at rate
proportional to pressure a pplied to control.
• Pressed:  Starts acquisition phase. Positions acquisition symbol or designator cursors depending on
direction of force applied to control.
• Released (cursor in tactical area of display):  Commands radar lock -on, target designation, or
active processing depending on mode of operation.
With the “Realistic TDC Slew” option enabled under the Special settings for the F/A -18C, the TDC must be held
down to slew certain display formats, such as the AGM -65 Maverick.
Antenna eleva tion control . The AN/APG -73 radar can have its antenna dish rotated up and down to alter the
radar elevation scan. This rotary allows the pilot to position the antenna elevation scan. Controls are u p [=] and
down [-]. [F/A-18C] DCS

 Exterior lights switch  [L]. The exteri or lights master switch, on the outboard left throttle grip, provides a
master control for the following exterior lights: position lights, formation lights, strobe lights , and refueling probe
light.
• OFF (AFT) . Power for lights controlled by switch is cut o ff.
• ON (FWD) . Power is available  for lights controlled by switch.
RAID/FLIR FOV select button [I]. Depending on the controlled sensor or weapon, this button has multiple
functions:
• Selects the RAID mode when the radar set operating mode is Track While Scan (TWS) or Single
Target Track (STT).
• When HARM is selected , cycles HARM targets from center outwards.
• When ATFLIR or TGP is active, cycles between FOV settings.
• When in Maverick mode, toggles  FOV.

ATC Engage/Disengage  [T]. The ATC approach mode is eng aged by pressing and releasing the  ATC button
on the left throttle with the flap switch in HALF or FULL and the trailing edge flaps  extended at least 27°. When
ATC is engaged in the approach mode, the flight control computer  modulates engine thrust  to main tain on -speed
AOA. The computer uses inputs of AOA, normal load  factor, stabilator position, pitch rate, and angle of bank to
generate command signals. These signals  drive the engine mounted throttle control units which in turn command
the engine fuel cont rols. The  computer uses AOA as the primary input to generate command signals. However,
normal load factor  provides increased stability, stabilator position provides increased or decreased thrust  for pilot
induced  pitch changes, pitch rate provides lead dur ing pitch maneuvers, and bank angle provides additional  thrust
during banking maneuvers. Normal disengagement is accomplished by pressing the ATC button  or applying and
holding force to either throttle. Automatic disengagement occurs for the following  reasons:
• Flap AUTO up
• AOA sensor failure
• Two or more failures of either trailing edge flap
• Trailing edge flap deflection less than 27°
• ATC button fails
• FCES channel 2 or 4 fails
• WOW
• FCS reversion to MECH or to DEL in any axis
• Left and right throttle angles dif fer by more than 10° for more than 1 second
• Bank angle exceeds 70°
• Any internal system failure
• Selection of gain ORIDE

ATC Cruise Mode. The ATC cruise mode is engaged by pressing and releasing the ATC  button on the left throttle
with the flap switch in AUTO. When ATC is engaged in the cruise mode, the  existing airspeed is used by the flight
control computer to modulate engine thrust  to maintain this  existing airspeed. The existing airspeed is the
airspeed  being sent from the ADC to the flight control  computers via the mission computers. An ADC failure
inhibits the ATC cruise mode of operation. The  FCC uses true airspeed from ADC via the mission computers at
the time of engagement to generate a  command signal. This signal is then used as a reference to gen erate an
error signal that drives the  engine mounted throttle control units. Normal disengagement is accomplished by
pressing the ATC  button or applying and holding force to either throttle. Automatic disengagement occurs for the
following reasons:
• Flaps H ALF or FULL
• ATC button fails  DCS [F/A-18C]

 HEADS -UP DIS PLAY (HUD)
The Head s-Up Display, or HUD, is one of your most important instruments and provides valuable information as
to your aircraft flight performance and weapon / sensor information. In later sections of this guide, we will discuss
aspects of the HUD  that are specific  to certain weapons and sensors, but the HUD does have a common set of
information that is almost always displayed.

The HUD as pictured below is independent of aircraft Mast er Mode except for the bank angle scale, vertical
velocity, and heading scale.

Figure 22. Basic HUD Information
Heading . This 30 °, moving  heading scale displays the aircraft ’s magnetic or true heading (set in HSI/DATA).
The aircraft ’s heading is indicated as the caret in the center of the scale. When true heading is selected, a “T” is
placed below the heading caret.
Airspeed . Calibrated airspeed as determined by the Air Data Computer (ADC).
Vertical Velocity . Positive or negative aircraft altitude change in feet per minute.
Altitude . Barometric or radar altitude in feet as set by the ALT switch on the HUD control panel. When radar
altitude is selected, an “R” is displayed next to the altitude box. If the radar altitude is invalid, a flashing “B” is
displayed to indicate that barometric altitude is being used instead.
Angle of Attack . True angle of attack in degrees of the aircraft.
Mach Number . Aircraft speed as Mach airspeed .
Aircraft g. Normal acceleration value of the aircraft.

Velocity Vector . Represents the point toward which the aircraft is flying along the aircraft ’s actual flight path.
When not displaying accurate information, the symbol will flash. The Velocity Vector ca n be caged and uncaged
to the center of the HUD with the cage/uncage button on the throttle.
Flight Path/Pitch Ladder . The vertical flight path angle of the aircraft as indicated by the position of the
Velocity Vector on the Flight Path/Pitch Ladder. The aircraft ’s pitch angle is indicated as the aircraft waterline on
the Flight Path/Pitch Ladder.
Bank Angle Scale . With marks at 5 °, 15°, 30° and 45 °, rolling the aircraft to place the center caret in relation
to these marks provides a bank angle reference.
Barometric Setting . The barometric altitude is displayed below the altitude box for five seconds when the
barometric altitude is changed on the standby altimeter. It will also display if the aircraft is below 10,000 feet
and at an airspeed less than 300 kno ts if previously above both values.
Ghost Velocity Vector . When the Velocity Vector is caged  using the cage/uncage button on the throttle , the
Ghost Velocity Vector is displayed and shows the true velocity vector of the aircraft. When caged, the pitch ladd er
and velocity vector will stay caged to the center of the HUD.
As such, if you find the velocity  vector and pitch ladder off -center on the HUD, it is due to yaw or wind. To center
these, press the cage/uncage button on the throttle until caged and the Gh ost Velocity Vector shows “true”
velocity vector.

The FCS status display may be selected on a DDI. At top center, the display presents left and right leading -edge
flap (LEF), trailing edge flap (TEF), aileron (AIL), rudder (RUD), and stabilator (STAB) positions in degrees with
arrows which indicate the direction from neutral. For e xample: the control positions shown in the figure are left
LEF 1° leading edge down, right LEF 1° leading edge down, left TEF 5° trailing edge down, right TEF 5° trailing
edge up, left AIL 15° trailing edge down, right AIL 15° trailing edge up, both RUD 0° , left STAB 3° trailing edge
down, right STAB 4° trailing edge up. The tolerance for all control position indications is ±1°. The numbers and
arrows change as control surface deflections change. At 0° (neutral), the arrows may point in either direction. A
blank is displayed where the number is unreliable.
An X through the LEF, TEF, AIL, or RUD number, also referred to as a bold X, indicates that control surface is no
longer being commanded.
On either side of the position indicators are boxes which represent  the FCS channels. On the left side, reading
left to right, the boxes represent channels 1 and 4 for the LEF, AIL, and RUD and 1 2 3 4 for the TEF and STAB.
An X in one of these boxes indicates that the FCS is no longer using that channel to command the ac tuator due
to a failure. On the right side, reading left to right, the boxes represent channels 2 and 3 for the LEF, AIL, and
RUD and 1 2 3 4 for the TEF and STAB. On the lower right side of the DDI are boxes which display the status,
by channel, of the CA S pitch (P), roll (R), and yaw (Y); the stick position sensors (STICK), the rudder pedal force
sensors (PEDAL); the angle of attack sensing (AOA); the backup air data sensor assembly (BADSA); and the
processor (PROC); and the normal accelerometer (N ACC) a nd lateral accelerometer (L ACC). An X opposite one
of these components indicates a failure in the channel with the X. An X opposite degraded (DEGD) indicates a
switch failure or, for the TEF and STAB, a single shutoff valve failure. Flight controls are no t affected but the FCS
should be reset.
Except for the LEFs, the control  surface position may fail to match the commanded position without indication to

 An X in both CH1 and CH3 of PROC row indicates INS data is not being provided to the FCCs for sideslip and AOA
estimation calculations. There is no significant degradation to flying qualities, departure resistance or roll
performance with these failure indications.  (Above approxi mately 30° AOA in Flaps AUTO, the FCCs use INS data
for sideslip and sideslip−rate feedback to provide roll coordination and departure resistance. If INS data is not
available, sideslip control, departure resistance and roll performance may be slightly deg raded). The PROC X ’s in
CH 1/3 may be caused by: an INS failure, accompanied by an INS ATT caution; by placing the ATT switch to

Fuel (FUEL) Page . The FUEL display, which is menu selectable, is available  in-flight and on the ground.
Displayed is the fuel available in each tank, total internal fuel, total internal  and external fuel, and currently
selected BINGO fuel. A moving caret is shown on t he right side of each  tank to indicate the ratio of fuel available
to tank fuel capacity. The loss of  valid fuel quantity information for a given tank is indicated by display of 0
pounds fuel and INV  (invalid). Loss of valid information is as follows:
• All probes in a tank declared invalid by the SDC ( except left or right feed tanks).
• Tank 1 aft probe invalid while forward probe reads zero fuel.
• Tank 4 forward and center probes invalid while aft probe  reads zero.
An estimated (EST) fuel quantity is determine d by the SDC and displayed as follows:
• Use only the valid fuel probes in a multi -probe tank to estimate fuel available.
• Fuel probe invalid in left or right feed tank:
o Display 0 pounds if FUEL LO is present.

The internal fuel and total fuel indications display the sum of valid and/or estimated tank quantities. Each is  cued
as EST or INV as determined by the appropriate tank information with INV displayed if INV and  EST both apply.
The FLBIT PB will perform a test  of the FUEL LO warning system. During the test, the FLBIT label will be boxed.
During the test, you should note a FUEL LO caution, a voice alert, and a MASTER CAUTION indication. The full

Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) Page . The electronic attitude display indicator is available for
display on the left or right DDI as an alternative to the attitude display on the HUD. A small circle is displayed on
the ball to represent the zenith and a circle w ith an inscribed cross is displayed to represent the nadir. The pitch
ladder is displayed in 10° increments. A turn indicator which displays FCS yaw rate is provided below the ball. A
standard rate turn (3° per second) is indicated when the lower box is di splaced so that it is under one of the end
boxes. The EADI display is selected by pressing the ADI pushbutton on the MENU.
Selecting the INS or STBY options at the bottom of the display determines the source of attitude  information
used to generate the dis play. Upon power -up with WOW, the EADI attitude initializes to  STBY (STBY boxed), thus
using the standby attitude reference indicator for attitude source  information. With STBY boxed the EADI display
should be compared to the visual display on the  standby altitude reference indicator. If the pitch and roll attitude
display does not correlate on the two  instruments, the standby indicator is most likely defective, requiring
maintenance. Selecting the INS  option (INS boxed) uses attitude information provided b y the INS. Selection of
the INS or STBY on  the EADI does not change the source of attitude data for the HUD.
Airspeed and altitude are displayed in a box at the top left and altitude  source is displayed to the right of the
altitude box and the vertical vel ocity is displayed above the  altitude box. When ILS is selected , the deviation
needles are displayed in reference to the waterline  symbol. The ILS needles are in yellow when COLOR is selected

Let’s talk about each of these in reference to the image below.
Current Range Data . This informs  you of the current range of the aircraft until only 2,000 lbs. of fuel remains.
This is based on the current altitude and Mach. In the example below, this is 329 nm. When total fuel is less than
2,500 lbs., the TO 2000 LB  changes to TO 0 LB  and the data is in reference to zero fuel remaining. If true
airspeed is above Mach .9 , the range data is removed because they system is unable to calculate valid data.
Below is the data for BEST MACH and this lists the best Mach to fly to extend range at the current altitude. In
the example below, this is .54 Mach.
The bottom line of CURRE NT RANGE lists the calculated  range if the aircraft is flown at the optimal Mach at the
current altitude. In the example below, this is shown as 586 nm.

 Current Endurance Data . The top line of the ENDURANCE indicates the time in hours:minutes the aircraft can
fly at the current Mach and altitude. This is shown as 27 minutes in the image below. If total fuel is less than
2,500 lbs., the TO 2000 LB  changes to TO 0 LB . If ground speed is above .9 Mach, the time is displayed as LIM
(limit).
Below is the optimal  Mach to fly to maximize flight endurance time at the current altitude. This is displayed as
.41 Mach in the example below.
The bottom line indicates the flight endurance time if the aircraft is flown at best Mach at the current altitude.
This is shown as 1 hour and 54 minutes .

Navigation To Data . Below the Current data is listed the time to reach, fuel remaining in lbs., and fuel burn
rate as lbs. per nautical mile of a selected TACAN station or waypoint. From the HSI, box TCN or WYPT with a
valid navigation point and the time, fuel remaining, an d burn rate is automatically calculated for you.
Optimal Range Data . The Optimal  Range shows the altitude and Mach at which to fly to achieve maximum
range to 2,000 or 0 lbs. of fuel remaining. In the example above, this is shown as 37,900 feet, at Mach .8 4, with
a range of 1,012 nm with 2,000 lbs. of fuel remaining.
Optimal Endurance Data . This shows the altitude and Mach to fly to achieve the maximum flight endurance
time in hours:minutes to 2,000 or 0 lbs. of fuel remaining. In the example above, this is  shown as flying at 33,001
feet, at Mach .71, for a maximum endurance time of 2 hours and 5 minutes.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  95

 COLD START
In the following sections, we will provide “How To ” checklists for the primary procedures you ’ll need to understand
to get started in the F/A-18C.

There are two methods  you can use to start a cold and dark F/A-18C. The first, and easiest, is the Auto -Start. By
pressin g [LWin]  + [Home] , the aircraft will be started automatically for you. To cease the Auto -Start, you can
press [LWin ] + [End].
Being a DCS title though, the F/A-18C really shines when you take advantage of the detailed systems modeling,
like manually starti ng the aircraft.  In this guide, we will skip the Pre -Flight and Upon Entering Cockpit checks and
begin with the Before Engine Start checks.

1. Set the BATTERY switch to ON and confirm  both Left and Right Generators are ON. [RIGHT CONSOLE ]
2. Move and hold the fire detection switch to FIRE TEST A and wait for all the audio caution messages
to play. Once complete, wait 10 seconds and then do the same for FIRE TEST B. Between running
FIRE TEST A and FI RE TEST B, you can reset the battery switch to rewind the fire test tape. [LEFT

 AIRFIELD VFR LANDING

As a carrier -capable aircraft, the F/A-18C can land on both “the boat ” and airfields. Both landing patterns are
quite similar. For this guide though, we will just review the procedure for landing at an airfield  under Visual Flight

approach at 350 knots and 800 feet Above  Ground Level (AGL) along the heading of the landing runway and
offset yourself slightly away from your first turn into the pattern.

Five to ten seconds after your wingtip passes the end of the runway (the greater the time, the more time you
must establish your on -speed AoA on the downwind leg), turn into the downwind leg of the landing pattern.
Generally, pull 1% of  your airspeed in g. For example: 350 knots would equal 3.5 g. Roll out on a reciprocal
landing heading and an altitude of 600 feet AGL.
Your lateral offset from the runway should be about 1.2 miles.
Once your airspeed is below 250 knots, lower your landing gear and place your flaps in the FULL down position.

 Allow your airspeed to decay until you reach your on -speed angle of attack as indica ted left of the HUD on the
Angle of Attack Indexer. This will equate to 8.1 ° of angle of attack which will appear as the yellow circle on the
AoA Indexer. On the HUD, the Velocity Vector should be centered in the AoA “E” Bracket. Establish your on -speed
AoA at 600 feet AGL.
You will need to trim the aircraft to 8.1 ° AoA to be hands -free.

Turn into the landing base leg when your wing tip aligns with the runway threshold while maintaining on -speed
AoA. Your bank angle should be 30 ° and the HUD velocity vector should be just below the HUD horizon line. You
will need to slightly increase throt tle to maintain this AoA. Continue the on -speed descending turn until you are
aligned with runway landing heading (a good idea is to set your course line to the landing airfield along the
landing runway heading).
Maintain on -speed AoA with the HUD velocity  vector placed 500 feet past the runway threshold. Use your throttle
to maintain a 3° flight path.
At touchdown, reduce the throttles  to idle and use small rudder corrections to stay aligned down the runway roll -
out.

 CASE 1 CARRIER RECOVERY

Landing on aircraft carrier in Case I conditions is much like an airfield in VFR conditions. A Case I condition is
defined as visibility of at least 5 miles and clouds no lower than 5,000 feet. In other words, goo d weather, day
light conditions.
Call up the air -to-air radar page on your right DDI and HUD repeater on your left DDI.
Enter Navigation master mode and set the Master Arm Switch to SAFE on the [LEFT INSTRUMENT PANEL ]. Lower
the arrestor hook by pressing [H] and set HUD altitude to radar.

Entry into the Case I pattern would either be done from a port holding pattern (5 nm diameter circle at 1.5 to 5
thousand feet over the carrier) or a direct approach  into the upwind leg. In this guide, we will discuss a direct
approach.
Note: For a Case 1 recovery, neither TACAN nor ICLS are required. Those will be discussed in Case II and III
recoveries.
Approach the carrier from astern at 800 feet and 350 KIAS. Pass starboard of the carrier, and just close enough
that you can look down to the left and vis ually spot the carrier deck to make sure the deck is not foul.

At no more than 1.5 nm after passing the bow of the carrier, initiate a level turn to the left.

Generally, pull 1% of your airspeed in g. For example: 350 knots would equal 3.5 g. Roll out on a reciprocal
landing heading and an altitude of 600 feet AGL.  If your entry speed is above 350 KIAS, you may wish to extend
the airbrake until your airspeed decays to 250 KIAS. Once below 150 KIAS, lower the landing gear [G] and extend
flaps to FULL [LCtrl] + [F].

In the first 90 degrees of the second turn, maintain on -speed AoA and use throttle to adjust your decent rate
between 100 and 200 feet per minute with a roll angel of 27° to 30°. A good way to visualize this is to place the
velocity vector just below the horizon line on the HUD such that just the vertical post and right “wing” touch the

 As you pass the second 90 degrees of the second turn, allow your vertical velocity to increase to 500 feet per
minute and visually acquire the carrier and Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS ).
Upon rolling out on final approach to the carrier, all direction  is now dictated by the IFLOLS.
An optical landing system ( OLS) provides the pilot with glidepath information during the final phase of the
approach. The first OLS utilized a gyroscopically  controlled concave mirror. This mirror was vertically mounted
between two horizontal sets of green datum lights. An orange source light was shown in the mirror and would
appear as a yellowish orange “ball” to the pilot.
The position of the ball relative  to the datum lights would indicate the relative position of the aircraft to the
desired glidepath. If the ball was above the datum lights (a high ball), the aircraft was above the glidepath;
conversely, a low ball indicated the aircraft was below glidepath.  When the ball and the datum lights were aligned
horizontally, the aircraft was on glidepath.
The IFLOLS consists of a lens assembly, “cut” lights, waveoff  lights, and datum lights. The IFLOLS has three
modes of stabilization: Line, Inertial, and Point. Line Stabilization compensates for the ship ’s pitch and roll. Inertial
Stabilization operates the same as Line Stabilization, but also compensates for the up  and down motion (heave)
of the flight deck. Both modes stabilize the glideslope to infinity. The point stabilization mode fixes the glideslope
around a point 2500 feet aft of the lens. The system is normally set for a 3.5° glideslope targeting the 3 -wire.
The IFLOLS comes in both the shore -based and ship -based variants .

• Lens Assembly . The lens assembly is a box that contains 12 vertical cells through which fiber optic
light is projected. The upper cells are amber in color while the bottom two are red. Th e aircraft ’s
position on the glidepath determines which cell is visible to the pilot. The visible cell,  compared to the
horizontal  green datum lights, indicate the aircraft position relative to the glideslope (i.e., above, on,
or below the optimum glideslo pe). If a red lens is visible, the aircraft is dangerously low.
• Cut Lights . Mounted horizontally and centered above the lens box are four green cut lights. The cut
lights are used by the LSO to communicate with the aircraft during Zip Lip or Emissions Cont rolled
(EMCON) operations. As the aircraft approaches the groove, the LSO will momentarily illuminate the
cut lights to indicate a “Roger ball ” call. Subsequent illumination of the cut lights indicates a call to
add power. Zip Lip is normally used during d ay Case I fleet operations to minimize radio
transmissions. EMCON is a condition where all electronic emissions are minimized.
• Waveoff Lights . Waveoff  lights are mounted vertically on each side of the lens box. These red
lights are controlled by the LSO. When they are illuminated, the aircraft must immediately  execute a
waveoff. The LSO will initiate a waveoff any time the deck is foul (people or equipm ent in the landing
area) or an aircraft is not within safe approach parameters. “Bingo ” is signaled by alternating waveoff
and cut lights.
• Datum Lights . Green datum lights are mounted horizontally to the lens assembly with ten lights on
each side. The posi tion of the ball in reference to the datum lights provides the pilot with glideslope
DCS [F/A-18C]

 information. If the ball is illuminated above or below the datums, the aircraft is high or low
respectively
Upon the main gears contacting the landing area, immediately mo ve the throttles to full power in case the arrestor
hook misses the wires. This will allow the aircraft enough power to get airborne again.
If the “trap” is successful, retard the throttles to idle, raise the arrestor hook [H], set flaps to AUTO [F] and ta xi
out of the landing area.

 NAVIGATION
The F/A-18C has three master modes of operation: Navigation (NAV), Air -to-Air (A/A), and Air -to-Ground ( A/G).
The displays and avionics equipment operations are tailored as a function of the selected master mode. A/A
master mode is entered by either pressing the A/A master mode button or by selecting an A/A weapon with the
Weapon Select Switch. When A/A is selected, the radar display is placed on the right DDI, and the Stores
Management System (SMS) display is placed on the left DDI. A/G master mode is selected by pre ssing the A/G
master mode button. When neither master button is enabled (neither button lit), the F/A-18C is in the NAV master
mode.

Before using the F/A-18C navigation system, enable the system by placing the INS knob on the Sensor Panel to
the NAV position. [RIGHT CONSOLE ]
Navigation systems of the includes an Inertial Navigation System (INS), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN),
Automatic Direction Finding (ADF ), and Instrumented Carrier Landing System (ICLS). Together, these systems
provide accurate navigation day or night and in all weather conditions. The primary navigation indicator is the
Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) which is most often displayed on  the central MPCD. A moving map can also
be enabled with full -color capability on the MPCD, but not available on either DDI. The UFC is used for navigation
data entry.
The primary methods of navigation are the TACAN mode which provides steering to navigati on beacons and
Waypoint based navigation points created in the Mission Editor or while in the cockpit. Both modes provide DATA
pages for each TACAN station or waypoint, bearing and range to the location, time to reach the location, and
various steering aid s.
INS Alignment
The navigation system can be aligned by a variety of methods on the ground or in the air. This is started by
positioning the INS Mode Select knob on the Sensor Control  panel to the desired position. The INS knob is usually
set to IFA when  the alignment is complete.

CV (Carrier Alignment ). This is  the primary alignment mode  onboard  an aircraft carrier .
GND (G round Alignment ). This is the primary alignment mode on an airfield.
Mission Practice: F/A-18C VFR Navigation
 [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  119

 NAV (Inertial Navigation).  This operational mode is used on aircraft without Global Positioning System ( GPS)
equipment  installed.
IFA ( Aided INS  / Inflight Alignment).  In Aided INS (AINS) Mode, the INS and GPS data is integrated to
provide the best navigation data. This is the prima ry operating mode for aircraft with GPS.  This selection also
enables an Inflight Alignment mode if alignment is lost during flight.
Alignment Procedure
A full INS alignment should be accomplished prior to every flight. This is normally begun  just after en gine start
and avionics power -up to allow time for the full alignment to complete prior to taxi.
1. Verify the Parking Brake is set.
Releasing the parking brake before alignment is complete may result in an invalid alignment. The
alignment will need to be rei nitialized.
2. INS Mode Selector Knob  - GND on an airfield or CV on a carrier.
The alignment status may be monitored on the HSI page.

Alignment Type.  This identifies the alignment mode being used. Possible types include GRND (ground
alignment), CV RF (carrier alignment with position datalinked from ship), CV CBL (carrier alignment
with position provided by cable from ship), CV MAN (carrier alignment wi th position manually entered).
Alignment Quality. Initially, NO ATT will be displayed as the INS is calibrated for level. After
calibration, a number estimating the accuracy of the present position is displayed. When an acceptable
level has been reached, O K is displayed next to the QUAL number.
Time into Alignment. This starts to count up when the alignment begins.
Stored Heading Option.  Selecting Stored Heading after the alignment begins may  allow a faster INS
alignment in certain situations. This can be u seful for “scramble ” missions or for situations when your
play time is limited.

 WAYPOINT NAVIGATION
Waypoint navigation consists of a series of navigation points to create a navigat ion sequence. This allows point -
to-point steering along the sequence using automatic (AUTO) sequencing. Any waypoint can also be designated
as a target point (TGT) using the WPDSG option. Additionally, up to nine markpoint s can be created that can also
act as waypoints. Command heading, distance, and time to reach the selected waypoint is provided on the HSI
Waypoint Data Block and HUD.
Waypoint steering is selected by pressing the WYPT option button on the right side of the HSI. Below are
increment and dec rement arrows to select the steer -to waypoint as indicated between the arrows.
In the top right of the HSI, the bearing to, distance to and time remaining to reach the selected waypoint are
displayed in the Waypoint Data Block. Inside the compass rose, the  waypoint bearing indicator and waypoint

Time on Target (TOT) Navigation
Often in combat operations, it is vital to hit your target at a precise time in order to best coordinate with other
friendly forces. Based on a Time on Target, or  TOT, using Zulu time, the F/A-18C can provide you guidance to
reach your target at the entered TOT.
To do so, following these steps:
1. Select Horizontal Situation  Indicator (HIS) page from any display and then select the DATA / WYPT
page. Along the bottom p ortion of the DATA page are blank fields for the desired time on target Zulu
time, the ground speed from the initial point to the target point, and the waypoint that will serve as
the target from which the TOT will be calculated.

Figure 45. Time on Target Data Fields
2. TOT Entry . First, we will enter the desired TOT. To do so, first press the WPSEQUFC pushbutton 1.
This will then display GSPD (ground speed), TGT (target), and TOT (time on target) in the top three
Option Select Windows. Upon pressing the TOT Option Select Button, the T OT indication on the
Option Select Window will be colonized. Using the UFC Keypad, enter the hour:minute:second for the
TOT based on Zulu time. The format is HH:MM:SS, and once you then press the ENT button on the
UFC, the set TOT will then be displayed on  the DATA / WYPT page.
Note that current Zulu time is generally displayed in the bottom left corner of the HUD.

 TACAN NAVIGATION
The ARN -118 TACAN system provides relative bearing and/or slant range distance to a selected TACAN  station
(land, ship, or aircraft). TACAN range depends on aircraft altitude Line of Sight  (LOS) to the station but can have
a maximum range of 200 miles for an airborne station and 390 miles for a surface station. Each TACAN station
has a three -letter ide ntifier which is used to identify the beacon and is displayed on the HSI and HUD when using
TCN steering.
To use TACAN steering:
1. Select TCN from the UFC
2. Press X or Y of the desired channel from the UFC Option Select Window / Button
3. Turn on the TACAN by pressing the ON/OFF button on the UFC

TACAN Yard stick
A very useful function of th e air-to-air TACAN to find and keep formation with other aircraft is what ’s termed
“yardstick”. Although the datalink  combined with the SA page largely eliminates the need for this, yardstick can
still prove useful if the datalink  is inoperative.
It is important to remember that TACAN yardstick will only provide range information between you and the other
aircraft.
To enable TACAN yardstick :
1. Set TACAN to A/A mode on UFC
2. Set a TACAN channel 63 channels higher than the TACAN channel of the other aircraft, or have the
other aircraft set their TACAN 63 channels above yours. One aircraft should be between 1 and 63 X
or Y and the other(s) 63 channels higher from that. Note: be careful to avoid TACAN channels
already in use by airfields and aircraft carriers and channels 68 and 69 due to datalink  conflict .
Once set up, enable TCN navigation on the HSI and note that the heading needle will spin, due to the lack of
bearing informat ion. However, you will now have a distance indication. By altering your heading and noting the
range increase or decrease, you can often determine the general heading of the other aircraft.
Also note that TACAN yardstick can work between any aircraft with A/A TACAN, it does not need to be only
between F/A-18C’s.

 to any head ing shown on most displays. True north is used in the northern or southern areas of magnetic
unreliability (AMU) near the north and south magnetic poles.
When using TACAN navigation in true heading mode, the onboard TACAN database is used to lookup a stati on’s
magnetic variation. If the TACAN station is not in the TACAN database, TACAN courses will reference magnetic
north regardless of the selected heading mode.
Magnetic heading is sensed by the aircraft; true heading is derived from magnetic heading using  a magnetic
variation database. If the INS fails and the aircraft’s position is not reliably known, true heading is not available.

 AUTOMATIC DIRECTION FINDER (ADF)
NAVIGATION
A third method of navigation is Automatic Direction Finder (ADF). ADF uses radionavigation based on beacons in
the 108.0  to 400.0 MHz range. Either radio in the F/A-18C can be tuned to the desired ADF channel and receiving
steering information for the selected beacon . However, no range information is given. The bearing to the selected
ADF beacon is displayed as a circle on the outer periphery of the HSI compass rose.

Note that this ADF cannot be used with m ost non -directional beacons (NDBs), which transmit on frequencies
between 190 and 1750 kHz. It can be used to navigate to VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) stations, as those
typically transmit on frequencies between 108 and 118 MHz.  How to Navigate Using ADF Beacons
1. Select either 1 (COMM 1) or 2 (COMM 2) from the ADF switch on the UFC
2. Rotate the channel selector of the selected ADF switch to the Manual (M)
3. Using the UFC keypad, enter the fre quency of the desired ADF beacon into the UFC Scratchpad
and press ENT on the UFC

• Attitude Hold (ATTH) . The aircraft will maintain the existing pitch and roll attitude between ±45°
in pitch and ±70° in roll.
• Heading Select (HSEL) . When enabled, the aircraft will turn to and fly the heading as set on the
HSI.
• Barometric Altitude Hold (BALT) . When engaged, the aircraft will maintain the current heading
and barometric altitude between 0 and 70,000 feet.
• Radar Altitude Hold (RALT) . When engaged , the aircraft will maintain current  heading and radar
altitude between 0 and 5,000 feet.
• Coupled Hold (CPL) . This mode is available when TACAN or WYPT is the active navigation mode.
When engaged, the aircraft will fly to the selected waypoint or TACAN station. The autopilot can also
fly spe cific courses to a waypoint or station, or automatically fly to waypoints in a sequence.
Autopilot modes listed on the UFC are selected by pressing the Option Select Button next to the Option Select
Window of the autopilot mode. When selected, a colon is d isplayed next to the autopilot name on the Option

Using Coupled Autopilot Mode
When in Coupled mode, the autopilot can fly to a waypoint or a TACAN station, can fly a specific course to a
waypoint or TACAN station, and can automatically fly along a sequence of waypoints .
Coupled mode only controls roll, not pitch. You can either control pitch yourself, or activate one of the pitch
modes (BARO or RALT) together with CPL.

Figure 71. Coupled Autopilot Controls on HSI
The active sub -mode of coupled mode is displayed on either side of the ownship symbol on the HSI, and on the
right side of the HUD. “CPL TCN” is displayed when coupled to a TACAN, “CPL WYPT” when coupled to a waypoint,
“CPL SEQ1” when coupled to waypoint sequence SEQ1 with AUTO boxed, and “CPL OAP” when coupled to an
offset aimpoint.
If the autopilot has de -coupled because of something other than pilot -commanded disconnect (e.g., loss of TACAN
signal), the HUD indicator will flash repeatedly. The flashing will continue until the paddle switch is depressed.
When coupled mode is active, moving the stick will temporarily override it.

after crossing it. When boxed, the OVFLY option applies to all waypoints until unb oxed.
Flying a Course To/From a Waypoint or TACAN Station
To fly a course to or from a waypoint or TACAN, follow the steps above, while also selecting a course using the
CSEL switch or the UFC. The aircraft will turn to intercept the course (if not already  established), and then turn
to the fly the course once established. The course will be flown either inbound or outbound depending on the
selected course direction. (Use the HSI to help visualize which direction the aircraft will fly after intercepting the
course.)
After crossing the waypoint or station, the autopilot will continue following the same course outbound.
Flying Along a Sequence of Waypoints
When the autopilot is in coupled in WYPT mode, and the AUTO sequence option (PB 16) is boxed, the navigat ion
system will automatically activate the next waypoint in the sequence upon crossing each waypoint. Use PB 15 to
ensure the proper sequence is selected, and press PB 16 to box the AUTO option. When the autopilot is coupled

 INSTRUMENT CARRIER LANDING SYSTEM
(ICLS)

While real US Navy and Marine Corps  F/A-18C’s are not equipped with Instrument Landing System (ILS) for
airfiel d landings, they are equipped with the Instrument Carrier Landing System (ICLS). This operates much like
a traditional ILS system, but it is only operational for US aircraft carriers.
Using the ICLS is a matter of setting  up the correct aircraft carrier IC LS channel and following the localizer and
glideslope beams to within visual distance of the IFLOLS.

 AIR-TO-AIR RADAR
Perhaps the most important sensor of the F/A -18C is its ’ AN/APG -73 radar. The AN/APG -73 is an x -band, all -
weather, coherent, multimode , multi -waveform search -and-track sensor that uses programmable digital
processors to provide great flexibility in air -to-air tasks.
Basic Air -to-Air Radar  Information
The AN/APG -73 is a pulse -Doppler, look -down / shoot -down radar with both Beyond Visual Range (BVR) and
close in, Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) modes of operation .
The air -to-air radar display uses a standard B -scope format in which the ownship (your aircraft) is in the bottom
center of the display. As such, all indications on the b -scope are ahead of the ownship. Targets on the scope are
displayed in range from th e closest being at the bottom and the more distant being toward the top. Contacts left
and right of the ownship are represented as being indicted left and right of the center of the display to indicate
azimuth.
Important, basic components of the b -scope in clude:

Figure  77. A/A Radar  Basic Symbols
B-sweep . The B -sweep is a vertical sweep on the display that indicates the instantaneous azimuth position of
the radar antenna.
Antenna Elevation Caret . The antenna elevation caret symbol indicates antenna elevation in the vertical plane.
The symbol is pitch and roll stabilized in reference to the ownship horizontal plane. In search modes, the symbol
responds to the radar elevation control on the throttles.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  161

 Range Scale . The right side of the b -scope represents radar range. The scale includes marks for ¼, ½, and ¾
of the selected radar range.
TDC Acquisition Cursor . Consisting of two parallel, vertical lines, this cursor is moved in response to Throttle
Designation Control (TDC) commands on the throttles. When in a radar search mode, the altitude band being
covered by the radar beam is indicated above and below the cursor. When placed over a target symbol, the
contact ’s airspeed is indicated to the left of the cursor and it s altitude is displayed to the right.
Target S ymbols . Target symbols are displayed as solid rectangles (bricks). The horizonal position of the target
symbol indicates angular  position in respect to ownship heading. The vertical position indicates range.
AOJ “Dugout ”. Targets that are denying the radar range information are placed at the top of the b -scope in the
Angle on Jam (AOJ) “dugout ”. Only target azimuth information is available.
Pushbuttons . Around the periphery of the radar display are 20 buttons that can be used to control radar modes
and para meters. Depressing a button will enable or disable the function, or successive  depressions will cycle
through all available options for that function.
A/A Waypoint and Bearing and Range
To gain better situational awareness of the location of other aircraft , both an air -to-air waypoint (A/A Waypoint),
also referred to as a bullseye, and bearing and range indicators can be displayed on the A/A radar format. These
can be particularly useful in reference to position information from AWACS and other flights and being able to
send informative messages to your teammates.
A/A Waypoint
The A/A waypoint must coincide with a waypoint within the waypoint database. It is therefore necessary that the
selected air -to-air waypoint is the same position where Bullseye is set for the upcoming mission . Waypoint 59 is
automatically entered into DCS F/A -18C at the Bullseye location, however it must be designated as the A/A WP
once in the cockpit. To make a  waypoint an air -to-air waypoint, use pushbuttons 12 and 13 on the HSI or HI S
DATA sub -page to change the current waypoint to the waypoint corresponding with Bullseye. Press p ushbutton
2 (A/A WP) on the DATA subpage of the HSI; this will make the waypoint on the bullseye the selected air -to-air
waypoint.  DCS [F/A-18C]

With an A/A Waypoint created, it will then be visible on the A/A radar format as either a circle or diamond with
an arrow that points to magnetic north. I f the A/A Waypoint and the current waypoint are the same waypoint,
the symbol is a diamond. If, however they are different , the symbol is a circle.

Range While Search (RWS) is the default search mode for air -to-air or when an air-to-air missile is placed in
priority. RWS mode provides all -aspect (nose -on, tail-on) and all altitude (look -up, look -down) target detection.
The display shows range as the vertical axis and azimuth angle on the horizontal.
While in RWS mode, the radar  can maintain up to 10 trackfiles .

 3. Elevation Bar Scan . When in RWS, successive presses cycle between 1, 2, 4 and 6 bars of rast er
scanning. The greater the number of bars equates to a larger elevation volume being scanned.
However, the greater the number of bars equates to a longer period to complete a complete scan
(frame). Bar spacing is generally 1.3°; however, when 5 nm scale is selected, it is 4.2°.
The title of the pushbutton indicates the number of bars and the current bar. In the example image,
“4B 1” indicates that the radar is scanning bar 1 of a four -bar scan.
4. Silent (SIL) Mode . When SIL mode is selected (boxed), the rad ar ceases scan operation and places
the radar in standby mode. This is also indicated by the Iron Cross shown in the lower left portion of
the display.
When in SIL mode, the ACTIVE option is available in the top left corner of the display (replaces target
aging indication). When pressed, the radar will conduct one complete scan / frame based on the current
radar settings and properties. Once the scan is complete, it will automatically return to SIL mode.
5. Erase . By pressing the ERASE push button, all target history on the radar display is removed until
detected and displayed again. This also removes all history during Silent (SIL) operation. This can be
useful when a long age time is selected.
6. Heading . Ownship heading in degrees. This is generally the magneti c heading, but true heading can

21. Throttle Designator Control (TDC) Cursor . Two vertical lines with radar elevation volume above
and below can be slewed using the TDC when the TDC is assigned to the page.
22. Non-Cooperative Target Recognition  (NCTR). When under correct parameters, allows the
identification of  the STT -locked aircraft by type. See  the next section .
Single Target Track (STT) Mode
STT is e ntered at the completion of manual or automatic target acquisition.
• Pressing the TDC designate button when TDC cursor is over an RWS hit.
• Pressing the TDC designate button twice when the TDC cursor is over an LTWS trackfile.
• Use of AACQ mode or ACM mode.
STT is indicated by the radar attack display. The radar continually monitors the range and angle of the tracked
target. This data is used to compute missile or gun attack. The attack display provides intercept course and
launch/firing envelope based on comp uted data. ACM mode and STT launch envelope are not available in
navigation aircraft master mode. The AIM -7 requires an STT track for launch unless in HOJ or FLOOD modes.
Automatic Range Scale Adjustment is a function of an STT track. Automatic range scale  control is enabled when
the radar is operating in STT, or if the RSET pushbutton switch is pressed. If the L&S, DT2, or STT target has a
valid range and is within the tactical area, then it is used as a range scale control target. The digital data compute r
automatically adjusts the range scale so that the furthest range scale control target is displayed at between 40%
and 90% of the selected range scale. When the display is expanded about a range resolved L&S target, the digital
data computer dynamically a djusts the range scale so that the L&S target range is at the center and the display
range limits are that range of 5 nm. Automatic range scale control increments and decrements the range scale
in STT, but only increments the range scale in TWS. If the ran ge scale is manually adjusted, then automatic
range scale control is disabled until the RSET pushbutton switch is pressed.
It is important to understand that when in STT mode, the radar is only  focused on a single contact and will not
display other contact s.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  169


Figure 83. Single Target Track
Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) Mode
When a contact is tracked as the STT L&S target, the NCTR function allows aircraf t type identification under
certain parameters. The NCTR function can be selected from pushbutton 15 on the RWS format page.
NCTR works on the principle of the engine fan blades having distinct characteristics that can then be correlated
to an aircraft typ e. This can only be achieved with an STT track of the target and:
• Target is within 25 nm.
• Target is within 30° nose -on or tail -on.
The identification results are displayed on the SA page when the TDC cursor is placed over the target. The type
will then be displayed in the data block located in the bottom right corner of the page.
NCTR can be an important function for two-factor target identification.

 One-Look RAID
One-look RAID applies RAID processing to returns detected while in single -target track mode. This allows the
radar to display targets nearby the L&S as bricks. One -look RAID has the capability to break out targets within
about 1.5° of the L&S (one beam width). At 25 NM, one -look RAID can break out a target within 1 NM of the
L&S.
To activate One -Look RAID, box it on the DATA page. See Range While Search (RWS) DATA .

 Spotlight (SPOT) Sub -Mode
Spotlight (SPOT) is an air -to-air radar sub -mode that constrain s the radar azimuth to a specific area under the
TDC. SPOT mode provides a very high update rate and is used to discriminate between closely spaced targets
and acquire the desired target within a group.
SPOT sub -mode can be activated from any air -to-air radar mode except STT and STT RAID. To enter SPOT sub -
mode, first position the TDC over the area you wish to spotlight, then press and hold the TDC z -axis for more
than one second. The radar azimuth indicator will drive to the TDC location and begin a scan c entered on the
cursor and constrained to 22° of azimuth.

Figure 85. SPOT Sub -Mode
SPOT sub -mode is indicated by the presence of an “X” within the TDC. The scan area can be slewed by moving
the TDC left or right. To exit SPOT sub -mode, press and release the TDC. SPOT sub -mode is also exited by
pressing the undesignate button or assigning  TDC to another display.
SPOT sub -mode can also be used with an AACQ mode. When SPOT sub -mode is activated from an AACQ mode,
the radar will attempt to STT the first target detected while SPOT is active.

 Air-to-Air Radar  HOTAS Controls
When flying air comb at missions, it is very helpful to keep your hands on the stick and throttle and not have to
take your hands off them to manipulate controls. The F/A-18 has an excellent set of Hands -on Throttle and Stick
(HOTAS) controls. Here are some of the more importa nt HOTAS functions to know for air -to-air combat:
Control Stick
On the control stick, the Sensor Control Switch and the Undesignate Button are vital. When in Beyond Visual
Range (BVR) mode, pressing the Sensor Control Switch to the right will set TDC contr ol to the radar when on the
right DDI. When the display has the TDC assigned to it, a diamond with a dot in the center is displayed in the
top right corner of the display.
Pressing the Sensor Control Switch to the right when the TDC is already assigned to it will place the radar in Auto
Acquisition (AACQ) mode. If the TDC if over a target symbol when AACQ is commanded, it will instruct the radar
to lock on to that target . If AACQ is pressed with no target symbol under the acquisition symbol, the n the radar
will attempt to lock on to the closest target within the selected radar scan volume.
Sensor Control Switch . There are two general modes for this four -way switch. When in air -to-air mode:
When in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) mode, it functions as:
• Forward: Switch to Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) mode with Boresight being selected by default
• Aft: Assigned TDC to center, MPCD
• Left: Assigns TDC to left DDI
• Right: TDC to right DDI or enters radar in Auto Acquisition mode if TDC already assigned to the ri ght
DDI
When in ACM mode, the Sensor Control Switch works as:
• Forward: Radar Boresight (BST) mode
• Aft: Radar Vertical Acquisition (VACQ) mode
• Left: Radar Wide Angle Acquisition  (WACQ) mode
Weapon Select Switch . This is a five -position switch that allows yo u quickly to set the selected air -to-air
weapon as priority. In doing so, it will also set the radar to default settings to best employ the weapon:
• Forward: AIM -7 Sparrow
• Press Down: AIM -9 Sidewinder
• Aft: M61A 1 20mm Gun
• Right: AIM -120 AMRAAM
• Left: No Funct ion
Trigger . Fires forward directed weapons like the gun and air -to-air missiles.
Undesignate Button . When in air -to-air mode, the primary function of the Undesignate Button is to un -lock a
radar-designated targets. It can also be used to return to radar search mode when in a radar ACM mode.
Throttle
The two most important radar controls are the Throttle Designator Controller (TDC) and the radar elevation
control.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  173

 The radar elevation control is a wheel that when rotated back elevates the radar scan and when rotated forward
lowers the elevation scan.
The TDC is a cursor control with a press -button function. When assigned to the radar on the right DDI, it controls
the TDC acquisition cursor within th e radar tactical display area. When on the air -to-air radar display, the number
above and below the TDC cursor indicate the maximum and minimum altitude coverage of the radar at the range
of the TDC on the display.
When the TDC is moved across the display boundary, it can be used for radar mode and parameter changes. If
the TDC is moved over the boundary into the mode selection area, the mode options will appear on the display.
Positioning the cursor over the desired mode and depressing the TDC will command  the radar to display the
optimum parameters for the mode selected. Other parameters shown around the perimeter of the display may
also be controlled.

Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) Modes
The ACM radar modes are designed  for close -in combat with auto acquisition in mind. The ACM modes can be
selected by either pressing forward on the Sensor Control Switch while in air -to-air BVR mode, or by pressing aft
on the Weapon Select Switch to set A/A GUN as priority.
Except for the Guns Acquisition mode, any air -to-air missile can be used for all ACM modes.
How to Use Radar  in Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) Mode
1. Radar  control switch on the Sensor Panel to Operate (OPR)
2. Master Mode switch to A/A
3. Select Attack Radar (ATTK RDR) from the TAC page on the right DDI
4. Press forward on the Sensor Control Switch to enter ACM mode, or…
5. Press aft on the Weapon Select Switch to set A/A Gun as priority and place the radar in Gun Auto
Acquisition (GACQ) mode
6. Once in ACM mode, use  the Sensor Control Switch to select ACM modes: forward for Boresight (BST),
aft for Vertical (VACQ), and left for Wide Angle (WACQ)
There are four ACM modes:
• Gun Acquisition (GACQ)  mode is automatically enabled when air to air guns is selected. This mode
is represented as a 20°, dashed circle on the HUD that encompasses the entir e HUD field of view.
Unlike the other ACM modes, GACQ can only be used for guns. GACQ searches for targets out to 5
miles.
• Boresight (BST)  by pressing forward on the Sensor Control Switch. When selected, a dashed, 3.3°
circle is displayed on the HUD. This circle indicates the radar’s auto -acquisition search zone. BST
searches for targets out to 10 miles.
• Vertical Acquisition (VACQ)  mode is selected by pressing aft on the Sensor Control Switch. Upon
doing so, two, dashed vertical line are displayed in the HU D. This vertical auto -acquisition search
pattern covers from -13° to +46°. VACQ searches for targets out to 5 miles.
• Wide Acquisition (WACQ)  is a spaced -stabilized mode and is selected by pressing left on the
Sensor Control Switch. Upon doing so, a rectang le is displayed in the lower right corner of the HUD.
This rectangle represents the auto acquisition scan pattern and can be slewed using the TDC
controller when uncaged. The rectangle is placed on a grid that represents the complete scan limits
of the rad ar. WACQ searches for targets out to 10 miles.  DCS [F/A-18C]

176

 • Automatic Acquisition Mode (AACQ)  is selected from the BVR radar modes, like RWS. It is not
selected from the ACM modes. When in a BVR radar mode and the TDC cursor is not over a target
symbol, the radar will attempt to auto lock the nearest target in its search pattern when the Sensor
Control switch is moved ri ght. AACQ searches for targets out to range setting of the radar.
WACQ Uncaged Mode
When WACQ is active, the scan area is normally caged to the center 6 0° of azimuth and 10° of elevation. By
depressing the TDC, you can uncage the scan area and slew it with the TDC. When you do, the scan area is
displayed on the HUD:

Figure 88. WACQ HUD symbology
Moving the TDC left or right shifts the 60° scan azimuth left or right within the 140° scannable cone. Moving the
TDC up or down shifts the 10° scan elevation up or down. The first target detected inside of 10 nautical miles
will be automatically locked.

 Track While Scan  (TWS) Mode for the F/A -18C
Overview
The Track While Scan (TWS) air -to-air acquisition mode of the radar is the ideal choice maintaining radar
situational awareness, track and engage multiple targets, have more azimuth control of the beam, and have the
tools to break -out targets in close formation.
TWS mode can be selected from pushbutton 5 on the attack radar page. Pressing  toggles between RWS and TWS
search modes. TWS appears like LTWS and includes L&S, DT2, LARs, etc. The primary difference is the ability to
show up to 10 trackfiles, plus raw hits, and more beam control options. The other big difference is that it allows
weapon engagement with the AIM -120.
In TWS mode, targets are ranked by threat priority. These are indicated with a HAFU and aspect stem (L&S, DT2,
and up to eight more Tracked Targets ). If HITS is enabled, up to 64 contacts can be displayed as a maximum.
HITS appear as “bricks” on the radar display.
Only targets within the current range display are ranked. However, if a target is ranked and the display scale is
changed such that a contact is no longer displayed, it is kept as a primary or secondary trackfile . In such a case,
this target would be at the very top or bottom of the display.
The highest priority target is always assigned as the L&S target. An L&S target in TWS can be commanded to
STT by designating it. L&S data and symbology is the same as we curr ently have in LTWS mode. If an TWS L&S
target is engaged with an AIM -7, the radar will automatically change to STT mode when launched.
The 2nd highest priority trackfile  is the DT2 target. This is also displayed the same as we have for LTWS mode.
When in TWS mode, press right on the Sensor  Control switch will place the L&S target into STT.
Target Designation
When TWS is first selected, the highest priority tracked target is automatically set as the L&S, but no DT2 is
automatically set. To designate any tra cked target as a DT2, designate that track using TDC Designate. To set
the DT2 track as the L&S track, designate the DT2 track (TDC Designate); this will swap the DT2 and L&S tracks.
You can also press  the Undesignate button to swap the L&S and DT2. If no DT2 is created, pressing the
Undesignate  button will cycle the L&S  among tracks  in priority order .
If there is a DT2, pressing the Undesignate  button will swap the priority of the L&S and DT2 targets. In this way,
you can quickly set the DT2 target as the L&S target.
Designating a  non-tracked  target ( “hit”) will set it  as a track. The lowest priority track would then be dropped,
displaying as a hit instead.
 DCS [F/A-18C]

 TWS Display Format

HITS  Option . When enabled, “raw” hits (bricks) are displayed that are outside the 10 ranked trackfiles. These
are essentially RWS contacts that can be displayed in TWS mode. They are also rendered at a lower in tensity
than the trackfiles.
TWS Option . If the radar is in STT mode with AIM -9 or AIM -7 selected, the TWS option is available. If selected,
it will exit STT to TWS and make the previous STT target the L&S.
Azimuth Option  / Elevation Bars Option . When in T WS, there are three bar options with corresponding
azimuth options:
• 2 bar = 20°, 40°, 60°, and 80°
• 4 bar = 20° or 40°
• 6 bar = 20°
For 4 and 6 bars, the elevation bar spacing is 1.3 -dgrees. For 2 bars it is 2°.
Azimuth Centering Options . When in TWS mode, the AUTO and MAN options are available on the right side
of the display. This allows either manual or automatic scan centering based on which option is selected/boxed.
• AUTO : The azimuth and elevation TWS scan is centered on the L&S trackfiles. If TWS  is entered
from an STT track, AUTO mode is automatically selected.
When in AUTO mode, the player should be able to place their TDC cursor anywhere but on a contact
and depress the TDC switch to re -center the scan azimuth on that location. When this is don e, AUTO
is replaced with BIAS on the display. This sets a new scan centroid. BIAS is removed when RESET is
pressed, TWS is exited, RAID is selected, MAN mode is selected, or no trackfile  exists.
• MAN: The scan center will not change automatically, but rathe r the azimuth scan center can be
moved with the TDC cursor. If the scan is positioned outside the gimbal limits of the radar, the scan

 will be repositioned such that the scan will be able to search its entire azimuth. MAN mode is the
default.
Trackfiles th at move outside of the scan volume area will disappear after a few seconds.
RESET . When pressed, all manually added trackfiles are dropped and resumes normal tracking and trackfile
prioritization.

Expand (EXP) . When there is an L&S target in TWS mode and EXP is pressed, the display will change to a 10
nm range centered on the L&S with a 20° azimuth scan. The display range on the right si de of the display will
indicate the 10 nm scan area (for example: 30 at the top and 20 at the bottom). Despite the 20° azimuth scan,
the legend will still indicate the previous setting and the b -sweep line will freeze on the L&S.

This mode simply zooms in on that area, but the TWS scan operation, target rankings, etc. does not change.
Trackfiles that are outside of the display will be clamped to the screen edge.

SCAN RAID Mode . This is selected from the SCAN RAID button on the thro ttle or by pressing PB9 (RAID). It
concentrates the TWS scan to a small area to break out closely spaced targets. When enabled, the scan is
centered on the L&S target. It is displayed in a standard range and azimuth format in 10 nm zoomed in display
at 22°  of azimuth, with a 2 -bar elevation. The b -sweep line is frozen on the L&S target and SCAN RAID appears
at the bottom of the display.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  181


When in this mode, trackfiles  and raw hits are displayed. If a new L&S target is designated, the RAID SCAN will
move to that location. Trackfiles that are outside the display area will be clamped to the edge of the display.
When selected, AUTO scan centering is automatically selected and cannot be unselected while in this mode.
Latent Track While Scan (LTWS) Mode
When in RWS mode, the LTWS option is available on the DATA sub -level of the attack radar format. The LTWS
option is initially boxed by default, indicating that LTWS is selecte d. LTWS is only available when the radar is in
RWS mode.
When LTWS is disabled (unboxed), no HAFU symbols will be displayed on the radar, only bricks representing
radar returns. Boxing LTWS will display HAFU symbols for MSI trackfiles supported by the rada r only — in other
words, donor HAFUs from other aircraft will not be displayed, only HAFUs that are correlated to radar returns.
When LTWS is boxed, the pilot can designate the HAFU trackfile under the acquisition cursor. Designating a
trackfile displays i ts speed (in Mach) and altitude on either side of the HAFU, just as in TWS mode. If the
designated trackfile is one of the eight priority trackfiles, its launch zone will also be displayed.
Designating an LTWS trackfile sets it as the L&S target (indicated  by a star inscribed in the HAFU). Once the L&S
has been set, designation of a second trackfile will make that trackfile DT2 (indicated by a diamond inscribed in
the HAFU). In this manner, two trackfiles can be tracked, and a third can also be tracked by h overing the
acquisition cursor over its HAFU symbol.
It is important to note though that weapons cannot be employed in LTWS  mode . To employ a weapon, the
radar must be in STT or TWS mode.
When LTWS is unboxed, HAFU symbols are not displayed, even when the acquisition cursor is hovered over a
radar target.

 Multi-Sensor Integration (MSI)
When LTWS mode is enabled, the pilot can further enable multi -sensor integration (MSI) using PB 14. When MSI
is boxed, donor targets are displayed as HAFUs even when the TDC is not over an L TWS trackfile. This makes
the radar presentation appear like the SA format, giving the pilot a more complete air -to-air picture
Trackfiles detected solely by onboard sensors (without a contributing donor aircraft) are displayed as standard
RWS bricks.
Note that MSI for RWS can only be dis played when the LTWS mode is enabled.

 AZ/EL FORMAT
The azimuth -over-elevation (AZ/EL) format displays a forward -looking view of targets detected by the radar and
other sensors. Unlike the normal Attack Radar format, which is a top -down B -scope display, the AZ/EL format is
a boresight display, showing the “view  out the nose.” The AZ/EL page combines HAFU symbols from the multi -
sensor integration (MSI) platform with returns detected by either the radar or the FLIR.

HOTAS Controls
The AZ/EL page can be quickly brought up using the HOTAS when it is not already displayed. When in A/A master
mode, bumping the Sensor Control Switch left will put the AZ/EL page on the left DDI, if the lef t DDI cannot take
TDC priority (e.g., the Stores format).
Pressing the TDC designate when the cursor is over an MSI trackfile designates that target as the current L&S.
If an L&S is already designated, the trackfile under the cursor is designated the DT2. If the target under the
cursor is the DT2, pressing TDC designate will make it the L&S, and the previous L&S will be erased. (It will not
be downgraded to DT2.)
When the sensor mode is set to FLIR, releasing TDC designate when the cursors are over a trackf ile commands
the FLIR LOS to that trackfile. The FLIR will continuously track that target, even when the L&S changes. Boxing
the L+S pushbutton (see FLIR Sensor Mode , above) will return FLIR LOS to the L&S.
Pressing and holding TDC designate when the cursor is not over an MSI trackfile, but in the display area, changes
the cursor to a pointing cross. See Changing Radar Scan Centerpoint , below.
Bumping the Sensor Control Switch in the direction of the DDI showing the AZ/EL format commands the radar
to attempt single -target track (STT) on the MSI trackfile under the cursor. If  the radar is already in STT mode,
bumping the Sensor Control Switch in this manner commands a break -lock.

160 nm. Pressing the down arrow with 5 nm selected has no effect and pressing the up arrow with 160 nm
selected has no effect. Ranges can be set in the MAP, SEA, GMT, and TA mode s.
Range selection is not available if there is an OAP or designated target, and instead will automatically base the
range on the OAP or designation when the target exceeds 93 percent/45 percent of the range scale.
Range scale options include:
• MAP - all scales
• SEA - 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 nm
• GMT - 5, 10, 20, and 40 nm.
• TA - 5 and 10 nm.
• GMT/MAP INTL - 5, 10, 20, and 40 nm
• SEA/MAP - All scales, but targets shown only to 80 nm.
PEN/FAN (Pencil/Fan) Beam.  Either a pencil or fan radar beam can be used for the scan by consecutively
pressing this pushbutton between PEN and FAN when in MAP, GMT, SEA, EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 modes. Different
modes have different default beam modes. When in MAP, SEA, or GMT modes and the antenna is greater than
5.5° down, FAN mode is a utomatically selected. If in EXP1 mode, FAN is automatically selected if the angular
amount of the ground coverage is greater than 5.5°. In EXP2 and EXP3 modes, PEN mode is boxed, and FAN
mode cannot be selected.
EXP1/EXP2/EXP3.  When the radar is operating  in MAP mode, EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 options are displayed. If
there is no OAP or designation, selecting and EXP mode removes acquisition cursor from the display and the EXP
indicator is superimposed on the MAP display. This is termed MAP  W/SECTOR, MAP/PATCH , and MAP  W/SAR.
The TDC is used to position the EXP scan area on the MAP. This is done by depressing and holding down the
TDC switch to slew the EXP area and then releasing the switch to begin the EXP scan and display of the selected
MAP area. The selecte d EXP mode is boxed.
If a designated target or OAP exists, selecting an EXP mode initiates and EXP scan and display that is centered
on the target/OAP.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  193

 If already in EXP  1 and either EXP  2 or EXP  3 is selected with no OAP or designated target, the EXP  2/EXP 3 scan
area is superimposed over the EXP  1 area. This is done by depressing and holding down the TDC switch to slew
the EXP area and then releasing the switch to begin the EXP  2/3 scan and display of the selected EXP  1 area.
If already in EXP  1 and eithe r EXP 2 or EXP  3 is selected with an OAP or designated target, the EXP  2/EXP  3 scan
is centered on the OAP or designated target.
If already in EXP  3 and EXP  1 or EXP  2 is selected, an EXP  1 scan is initiated that is centered on the EXP  3 area.
EXP 1 and 2 are limited to 40 nm and EXP  3 is limited to 30 nm.
AG Radar Display
The AG radar display consists of the following elements:

Antenna Elevation Caret. This caret indicates the radar antenna elevation in the vertical plane. It is pitch and
roll stabilized to the aircraft’s own horizon. The elevation is controlled by the radar elevation control on the
throttle.
Radar Display Grid. The azimuth and range grid lines and range arcs are displayed in the tactical area and are
displayed at 0°, ±30°, and ±60°. The four range arcs are separate the range setting into four equal range
segments. When in an E XP mode, the expanded areas cover 45° in azimuth for EXP1 an EXP2 covers 12° in
azimuth. Coverage of EXP3 is based on range.
Acquisition Cursor. This cursor consists of two parallel, vertical lines and is the same symbol as the air -to-air
radar TDC cursor.  It can be used in the non -tactical area to select options and designate in the tactical area. It
has both slew and press/release functions. When the radar is in a tracking mode, the cursor is no longer visible.
Aircraft Altitude.  In the lower right corner  of the display, the aircraft’s altitude is displayed in increments of 10
feet. This operates the same as on the air -to-air radar display.
Mach Number.  The aircraft Mach to the nearest hundredth is displayed in the bottom left corner.
Airspeed Indicator.  Calibrated aircraft airspeed is displayed increments of 1 in the lower left corner of the
display.

HOTAS Controls
The four HOTAS controls to manipulate the AG radar are the TDC, radar elevation control, the sensor control
switch, and the undesignate/nosewheel steering switch.


TDC
If assigned to the AG radar display, it can be used in the non -tactical area to select options. Non -tactical “zones”
that the TDC can be placed to display and initiate options include:
• Mode select
• Map gain increase/decrease select
• AIR select

 • Range increment and decrement select
• ACTIVE select
• PEN/FAN select
• EXP1/EXP2/EXP3 select
• INTL select
When in the tactic al area while operating in MAP, GMT, or SEA modes, a press and release sets a designation.
When pressed, the acquisition cursor is blanked, and the in -video cursor appears. When the TDC switch is
released, the stabilized cue is displayed at the in -video cu rsor intersection. Once a designation is made, the range
increment/decrement and the reset options and symbols are removed from the display. Additionally, radar
antenna elevation cannot be adjusted.
Radar Elevation Control
When in MAP, GMT and SEA, rotatio n of this control adjusts the antenna elevation angle.
Sensor Control Switch
This switch is used to assign the TDC to a display. If the radar is on the right DDI and the switch is moved to the
right, the TDC is assigned to the right DDI with the radar disp lay, and conversely with the left DDI.
If the TDC is already assigned to the DDI with the radar display, pressing the switch again in the direction of the
radar display commands an acquisition on press and a track on the release.
If already tracking, the s ensor control switch can be held (pressed) in the direction of the DDI with the radar
display, and the TDC can then be used to slew the in -video cursor. Upon release of the sensor select switch, the
radar will attempt to track the new location.
If the radar is in track mode, pressing the sensor control switch to the right will break lock on an FTT or GMTT
track and the radar will return to search mode (MAP, GMT, or SEA).
When the sensor control switch is pressed forward, it assigns the TDC to the HUD an d the radar is placed in AGR
mode if the radar is not tracking.
Undesignate/Nosewheel Steering Switch
If tracking when pressed, this switch will command the radar back to search mode and undesignate the aimpoint.
AG Radar Search Modes Operation
The master modes of the AG radar include and are cycled by presses of the Mode Select pushbutton (MAP >
GMT > SEA > TA > MAP):
• Real Beam Ground Map (MAP). This is the initialized, default mode.
• Ground Moving Target (GMT)
• Sea Surface Search (SEA)
• Terrain Avoidance (TA ) later in early access.
Other modes and sub -modes include:
• GMT/MAP Interleave (INTL)
• SEA/MAP INTL  DCS [F/A-18C]

196

 • Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS)
o Expand 1 (EXP1) Sector
o Expand 2 (EXP2) Patch
o Expand 3 (EXP3) SAR
MAP Search Mode
The MAP mode is used to illuminate the terrain  and acquire large discrete ground objects. It can rapidly map
large areas to identify landmarks for designation. Returns are displayed over eight, separate intensity levels to
create a picture. The picture is created by radar reflections off the terrain a nd objects and back into the antenna
for processing. MAP is displayed in a PPI format with zero range at the bottom of the display and the range
setting at the top of the display. Lateral displacement of returns is from the centerline of the aircraft.

Possible azimuth settings include 20°, 45°, 90°, and 120°. Range setting are from 5 to 160 nm.
The antenna scan is pitch and roll stabilized.

EAGLE DYNAMICS  197

 EXP Modes
From MAP mode, EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 Doppler beam sharpening modes can be selected from the top option
buttons.
As the radar first scans the selected region, it builds the first frame. With each new frame, the image is updated
which can take several seconds. The time to create a frame is inversely proportional to the angle of track and
can vary from 3 to 8 seconds (the closer the frame is to aircraft heading, the longer it will take). However, the
FAST option can be enabled to decrease frame creation time, but image quality will suffer.
EXP1 provides a higher resolution picture of a selected MAP secto r.

As noted earlier, the EXP1 azimuth is 45 ° and EXP2 is 12.6 °. Due to Doppler frequency shift, the mapped areas
to the side of the picture will be better formed than those directly in front of the aircraft. As such, DBS maps
(EXP1 and EXP2) are generall y created to the side of the aircraft heading.
EXP2  provides the next highest resolution of a small area.
DCS [F/A-18C]

198


EXP3 provides the highest resolution and uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing to create the image.

When EXP3, the display is converted t o a B-scan format (square), the top of the display is still oriented toward
the relative direction of the patch being mapped. The maximum and minimum ranges covered in the sector/patch
are displayed in the top and bottom of the radar display on the right s ide of the DDI.
If in EXP3 and the range to a designated stabilized target is less than 5.7 nm, the display changes to EXP2. If the
range is then less than 3.0 nm, EXP1 is automatically selected.
[F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  199

 GMT and GMTT Modes
The Ground Moving Target (GMT) mode scans  for and highlights moving targets, detected by their Doppler shift.
Detected targets are displayed as bricks:

The shaded area of the display shows antenna azimuth coverage.
Moving the TDC over the target brick and pressing the SCS in th e direction of the MPCD will command acquisition
of the target. Releasing the SCS will command track. The radar mode will change to Ground Moving Target Track
(GMTT) and additional target information will be displayed:
Moving target  DCS [F/A-18C]

Pressing the Undesignate button will return the radar to GMT mode.
The GMT and MAP modes can be interleaved by pressing the INTL pushbutton (PB 6). The mode will change to
GMT/MAP, and the radar will alternate between MAP an d GMT modes. Moving targets will be overlayed on the
map.
The GMT radar mode can be used in 5, 10, 20, and 40 nautical mile ranges. GMTT is effective out to about 10
nautical miles.
SEA Mode
The SEA mode is suitable for detecting ships and small islands at low sea states. Filtering is applied, scan rate is
reduced, and target integration time is lengthened to compensate for scattering caused by the sea surface.
SEA mode uses the same symbology and HOTAS commands as GMT and GMTT modes (documented a bove).
Ranges of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 nautical miles are available.
SEA/MAP interleaved mode is available just as with GMT/MAP. In SEA/MAP mode, the 160 NM range is available
for mapping, but seaborne targets will only be presented out to 80 nautical mile s.

 A/G Ranging (AGR) Mode
AGR mode is not manually selected, but rather enabled by the Mission Computer automatically under the following
conditions:
• When A/G master mode and the TDC is assigned to the HUD with bombs, rockets, or guns selected
while in C CIP mode.
• When in NAV or A/G master modes when a HUD, FLIR, or TGP designation is made.
• When in NAV or A/G master modes when AGM -65 is in track mode and the TDC is assigned to the
HUD.
In these cases, the radar in AGR mode is providing the ranging informat ion to the MC for weapon employment
calculations. The radar is slaved to the gun or rocket reticle, CCIP impact point of the bomb, or FLIR LOS.
On the display, the target range is displayed in feet, and the velocity (VEL) error is displayed. The error in k nots
is the difference between the target closing velocity measure by the radar and the best available aircraft velocity
measured along the radar LOS.
Although AGR is displayed next to the mode button, the button has no function when in AGR mode.

 Radar T racking Designations
Offset Aim Points (OAP) and targets can be designated manually on the radar display that include navigation
stabilized cursor designation and radar track designation. Radar track designations are only available in MAP, SEA
and GMT modes. Navigation stabili zed cursor designation is available in all modes.
A designation that is less than 10 nm will become a stabilized cue. If the stabilized cue is outside the radar
azimuth, it is removed.
Navigation Stabilized Cursor Designation
When in any of the modes, the TDC can slew the acquisition cursor (two parallel, vertical lines) on the display.
Once the TDC is depressed and held, the designation cursor (intersection of range and azimuth lines that span
the entire tactical area) replaces it.

While the TDC switch is held depressed, the designation cursor can be slewed with the TDC. When the TDC
switch is released, the designation cursor is designated and stabilized and is replaced with the stabilized cue. The
acquisition cursor also now reappea rs and can be slewed with the TDC.

 This process creates a designation point from which an AUTO attack could be initiated. And is also indicated on
the HUD as the designation point and steering indicator on the heading tape.

When a designation is made, the range increment and decrement options are no longer displayed, and the display
will automatically adjust display range scale to keep the stabilized cue within 93%/45% of the selected range
scale. The antenna elevation cannot be adj usted with a stabilized cue and the RSET option is removed.
With a stabilized cue with a weapon in AUTO mode, the weapon Time to Release is also displayed to match the

EAGLE DYNAMICS  205

 DL16 DATALINK  & MIDS
The F/A -18C for our simulation relies on two Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS) terminals that
allows the transmission and reception of data over the DL16 Tactical Datalink  (TDL) network. DL16 allows multiple
aircraft type s to share data with each other. In addition to data transfer, DL16/MIDS also supports secure voice
(MIDS 1 and MIDS 2 on throttle radio switch). Both the lower and upper radio antennas support the MIDS
terminal.
The primary purpose of DL16/MIDS is to prov ide a near -real-time picture of the tactical area around the pilot’s
aircraft. This includes ownship sensors, other friendly fighters on the network, and surveillance assets like AWACS.
All of these sensor sources are then correlated to create a unified si tuational awareness picture. This in turn
allows  a more coordinated engagement and less chance of fratricide. It can display up to 16 separate trackfiles.
MIDS can receive and display to the pilot three types of trackfile s over DL16to the MIDS terminal:
• Fighter -to-Fighter (F/F) . MIDS can receive up to seven donors (other fighters providing track
data) and each donor can share up to eight trackfile s. These are all correlated against  each other to
avoid duplicate trackfiles.
• Precise Participant Location and I dentification (PPLI) . This is the data that allows the display
the location  of the donor, what its sensors are doing, and payload remaining.
• Surveillance Tracks (SURV) . These are non -fighter aircraft data sources like AWACS and radar
ground stations.
Track files from each of these three sources (offboard) are then correlated with the sensors of the player ’s aircraft
(onboard). This is termed Multi Source Integration (MSI). Trackfiles that correspond to the player’s aircraft are
not displayed.
• Trackfile infor mation can be displayed three ways:
• Air-to-Air Radar Display
• Situational Awareness (SA) Display
• Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS)
For this simulation , all network options will be configured automatically.

 MIDS Secure Voice
In addition to the ARC -210 radio COMM1 and COMM2, MIDS  provides
two additional, secure radio transceiver s, MIDS A and MIDS B . Transmit
over MIDS A by pressing the Comms Switch forward, and over MIDS B
by pressing the Comms Switch aft.
Volume level of MIDS A and MIDS B is controlled by the volume
knobs on the volume panel on the left console. Note that the CRYPTO
switch should always be in the NORM position. If set
momentarily to HOLD or ZERO, it will erase the secure radio settings
for MIDS A and MIDS B.
MSI Trackfiles
Multi-Sensor Integration (MSI) Trackfiles  are objects (symbols and data)
which are generated either by external sources (F/F donors and
SURV), or by internal sensors (e.g., radar hits). Trackfiles are radar
contacts which have been classified by the M ission Computer  and/or
the pilot as “onboard ” and/or from external donors as
“offboard ”. These tracks are often represented on the screen by a symbol known as a HAFU.
When the Radar sweeps a track for the first time, the track is assigned a rank based on a number of basic factors
and weighted according to things like range, speed and aspect in order to prioritize it in terms of a potential
tactical threat .

Contacts on the SA page are displayed as HAFUs (Hostile, Ambiguous, Friendly, or Unknown ). They consist of
multiple components th at can include:
• Color: Green for Friendly, Yellow for Unknown, and Red for Hostile
• Top Half: The top half of the symbol indicates identification from your onboard sensors
• Bottom Half: The bottom half of the symbol indicates the identification by offboard s ensors (donors)
• Threat Rank: If the contact is detected by your sensors and is an Unknown or Hostile, its threat rank
is displayed as a number in the center of the HAFU
• Vector: A line leading from the HAFU indicates the contacts direction of travel
• Shape: The top and bottom elements of the HAFU can have three shapes:
o Hemisphere: Friendly
o Bracket: Unknown
o Caret: H ostile
PPLI SA Symbols
Aircraft that incorporate DL16 datalink  equipment (MIDS or JTIDS radios) can broadcast their location to other
aircraft over the same network. The Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI) indicator on the SA
page shows their location, and a TDC cursor over the contact displays its  information in the lower, right data
block.
Based on the ability of the unit to share data over the network, its symbol will vary:
 Basic PPLI symbol. Basic location with no sensor sharing.
 Command and Control PPLI symbol (AWACS). Location with survei llance (SURV)
sensor sharing.
 PPLI donor symbol. Location with fighter (F/F) sensor sharing.
Notes:
• PPLI symbols have a stem indicating heading.
• The PPLI symbol with dot in the center for a C2 unit is the AWACS aircraft (E -2 or E -3).
• All AI aircraft with JTIDS or MIDS terminals can act as donors (indicated as dot on left side of circle).

• Display of PPLIs can be toggled by pressing pushbutton 14 on the sensors sub -level of the SA page.
This can be used to help declutter  the display.
Onboard Sensor SA Symbols
Information pertaining to contacts that are only detected by your onboard sensors (ra dar) is indicate by the top
half of the symbol. Color and shape indicate its “side”. There are two ways to identify a contact just using onboard
sensors:
Mode 4 Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) . This function uses the F/A-18C’s built -in IFF system to interroga te the
contact with a coded pulse interrogation. If the contact returns the correct reply, the contact is deemed friendly
(green and hemisphere). If the contact does not return a correct interrogation, then the contact is deemed
unknown or hostile (if NCTR  prints the contact as hostile).
Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR).  Once an STT lock is made on the contact and NCTR is enabled
from the radar RWS format page, an NCTR print can be made if the contact is within 25 nm and within 30 ° off
the contacts  nose or tail.
To classify a contact as hostile BOTH identifications be made. A truly hostile contact that is just identified with
one identification will be displayed as unknown.
 Friendly (green and hemisphere) contact only using onboard sensors
 Unknown (yellow and bracket) contact only using onboard sensors
 Hostile (red and caret) contact only using onboard sensors
Because onboard sensors are involved in the identification, the threat rank is included in the center of the HAFU.
This is used for target sorting priority and determine the order in which a contact is locked using the AACQ mode.
As noted, a truly friendly contact  only requires a Mode 4 identification to be classified as friendly, it does not also
require an NCTR print.
Offboard Fi ghter-to-Fighter SA Symbols
Donor F/F symbols that can be displayed on the SA page include both hostile  and friendly elements. These are
part of the lower half of the HAFU. If it is a F/F only contact, there will be no threat rank displayed.
The HAFU incl udes a stem that indicates the contact ’s direction of travel.

  F/F donor friendly symbol
 F/F donor hostile symbol
Correlated Onboard Sensor and Offboard F/F and SURV Tracks
Contacts that detected by both your onboard sensors and offboard sensor(s) will have both upper and lower
elements to the HAFU symbol. This is termed a correlated contact. The color of the contact is based on the
onboard sensor identification and includes a threat rank unless the contact is determined friendly.
Note that if the onboard identification is different than an offboard identification, then the HAFU can be mixed.
This is termed an ambiguous contact. For example: if the player has a contact on thei r radar that has no IFF
identification, then the HAFU will be unknown. If an offboard donor (F/F or SURV) classifies the contact as hostile
though, the HAFU would have a rectangular top but a triangle bottom. In this way, there are many potential
HAFU comb inations.

Notes:
• For aircraft, the symbol also has a stem to indicate direction of travel.
• If a SURV track correlates to an F/F track, the F/F track symbol is displayed.
• If a SURV track correlates to an onboard only sensor track, an F/F symbol is displayed that indicates
onboard and offboard tracking.
• SURV symbols are only displayed if not correlated with PPLI,  F/F, or onboard sensor.
• If SURV tracking is lost on a contact, the symbol flashes at 3 Hertz for six seconds. If tracking is not
re-established, the contract is removed from the SA page.
Ranking of Target Symbols
Each trackfile HAFU is ranked from 1 to 16  if tracked by ownship sensors. The greater the potential threat, the

 AN/ASQ -228 ATFLIR
The Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) pod is a slewable electro -optical pod with laser
designation, ranging, and searching capability. It is capable of both video and infrared imaging, as well as moving
target tracking. The ATFLIR is eff ective in both the air -to-ground and air -to-air role. The ATFLIR can only be
mounted on the left cheek hardpoint, and weighs 424 lbs.
The ATFLIR is selected from the PB6 on the TAC page with the Master Mode set to A/G or NAV.
The ATFLIR camera is slewed us ing the TDC, when the TDC is assigned to the DDI displaying the FLIR format.
As with other formats, a small diamond appears in the top -right corner of the display when TDC is assigned to
that DDI. TDC assignment is done using the Sensor Control Switch on t he stick.
The three primary operating modes of the ATFLIR are standby (STBY), air -to-ground (A/G) and air -to-air (A/A).
The FLIR format is also available while the ATFLIR is warming up (“not timed out”).
The ATFLIR’s sensor suite is mounted on a gimballed platform that can move in two directions. The sensor
platform is normally stowed when the power switch is in OFF or STBY, when the landing gear is down, and when
the aircraft is stopped on the ground. When airborne and with the ATFLIR active, the  sensor platform rotates,
exposing the lenses.
The sensor platform is free to rotate in two axes but is limited by obscuration from the aircraft or the rest of the
pod structure. This is true of the FLIR and CCD video, the laser target designator, and the laser spot tracker.
When the sensors are obscured by a part of the aircraft or the pod itself, the sensors are said to be “masked.”
When the laser target designator (LTD) fires, it modulates the laser signal with a pre -coded pulse repetition
frequency (PRF). This PRF is coded as a four -digit number, from 1211 to 1688, which is used to distinguish
between different simultaneous laser de signations made by other aircraft or ground units. Likewise, when the
laser spot tracker (LST) searches for a laser, it does so using a specific PRF code, and ignores laser spots w ith a
different code (or unmodulated laser emissions with no code). The code  used by the LTD and the one used by
the LST need not be the same.
Sensor Control Panel
Power to the FLIR, laser target designator (LTD), and laser spot tracker (LST) is done using controls on the
Sensor Control Panel.

3. Laser Spot Tracker Power Switc h. Controls power to the laser spot tracker.
ATFLIR Activation
Before the targeting pod can be used, power must be applied. This is done by moving the FLIR Power switch
from OFF to either STBY or ON. After doing so, the targeting pod will enter a warm -up period. During this ti me,
the FLIR format will display NOT TIMED OUT:

 Tracking Modes
The ATFLIR is in one of the following tracking modes at any time:
• INR. This mode is active when the pod is being slewed. It maintains pod orientation relative to the
aircraf t by using inertial rate data from the aircraft.
• SCENE. The ATFLIR attempts to track the portion of the image under the reticle. This tracking mode
is effective against stationary targets without well -defined edges.
• INR SCENE. The ATFLIR enters this mode w hen the pod is slewed while in SCENE mode. The
ATFLIR will enter SCENE mode again once slewing is complete.
• AUTO.  The ATFLIR attempts to track an object centroid using a contrast -detecting algorithm. This
tracking mode is effective against stationary and m oving targets with well -defined edges, either in TV
or IR mode.
• INR AUTO. The ATFLIR enters this mode when the pod is acquiring a target while in AUTO mode.
The ATFLIR will enter AUTO mode once acquisition is complete.
• Designation. Pod LOS is slaved to the  designated target or target waypoint.
Initially the ATFLIR will be in designation mode or will be slaved to the VVI if there is no designation. Pressing
the SCS in the direction of the FLIR format will cycle between designation, SCENE, and AUTO modes. Pre ssing
the Undesignate button once will return to INR mode, and pressing it twice will slave the pod to the VVI.
In INR and SCENE modes, the pod can be slewed using the TDC. In designation mode, pressing down on the
TDC will activate slew and allow the desi gnation to moved. The TDC cannot be moved in AUTO mode, whether
or not the pod is tracking a target.

 Designating and Tracking Ground Targets
The ATFLIR will initially be slewed to the designated targ et, if one has been designated. For example, if you have
a waypoint in the vicinity of the target area, or an A/G radar lock in the target area, designating that waypoint
or radar lock will cause the ATFLIR to slew to that location. From there, you can ass ign TDC to the FLIR format,
and press down on the TDC to activate slewing. Use the TDC to locate the target and move the designation to
it.
Designate mode is an inertial -rates tracking mode, which means the pod is using the aircraft’s inertial data only
to track the target, which will incur inaccuracies over time. With the TDC assigned to the FLIR format, press the
SCS in the direction of the FLIR format to change to SCENE tracking mode. SCENE mode is suitable for tracking
stationary targets.
If you wish to  track a moving target, position the reticle just ahead of the moving target and then press the SCS
once more to change to AUTO mode. As the vehicle moves into the reticle, the pod will lock onto it and begin
tracking it. If the pod was unable to acquire t he target, cycle back to INR or SCENE mode, reposition the reticle,
and change back to AUTO mode for another attempt.
Once a target has been acquired by the pod, the designation can be used for attacks with laser -guided bombs.
See Laser-Guided Bombing  for more.
Pressing the Undesignate button will return the pod to INR mode.
Offset Designation
When in AUTO mode with a target acquired, pressing the TDC will show the Offse t Designation reticle:

Figure 111. Offset Designation Reticle
When the Offset Designation reticle is displayed, the coordinates in the top -right datablock reference that reticle
instead of the tracke d target. You can slew the Offset Designation reticle using the TDC. The Offset Designation
reticle always moves relative to the tracked target; it is not ground -stabilized.

 Designating Targets Using the Laser
The laser target designator/rangefinder (LTD/R ) is a pulsed laser that is automatically aimed along pod line of
sight. In the designation role, the laser can provide a guidance solution for laser -guided munitions, both onboard
the designating aircraft and from other units; and it can train other platf orms’ sensors onto the designated target.
In the range -finding role, the laser provides continuous target slant range measurements to the aircraft avionics.
To use the LTD/R, the LTD/R switch on the Sensor Control Panel must be set to ARM. Normally, the la ser will fire
automatically when designating a target, launching an AGM -65E, or dropping an LGB. Boxing the TRIG option
(PB 11) allows the laser to be controlled by the trigger. This is useful when buddy -lasing (designating a target
for another aircraft to  fire upon).
Using Laser Spot Tracking
The ATFLIR can also detect and track laser signals emitted by other aircraft or ground units, in laser spot track
(LST) mode. In this mode, the targeting pod searches for a laser signal by its PRF code. When the laser  signal is
detected, the pod slews to the target being designated by that laser. Laser spot tracking can by other aircraft or
ground units to slew your targeting pod onto their target.
To set the PRF code that the laser spot tracker searches for, press PB 14 (UFC) on the FLIR format. Box PB 17
(labeled LST) to activate LST mode. The display will initially blank:

Figure 113. LST Display After Laser Detection
Once a designation laser is detected, the pod will slew to its location, and “LST” will be displayed at the top of
the FLIR format. You can then designate the target or switch to a tracking mode , and LST mode will automatically
exit.
Manually Controlling Level and Gain
Normally the video level (brightness) and gain (contrast) is controlled automatically to produce the best picture.
If needed, the pilot can manually adjust level and gain to identi fy targets that would otherwise appear washed
out or too dark.
To manually control level and gain, unbox the ALG option at PB 19. After doing so, the ZOOM and FOCUS controls
will be replaced by level and gain controls:

LITENING II TARGETING POD  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  239

 AN/AAQ -28 LITENING  II
The Litening  II Targeting Pod is a combination TV video and infrared video sensor platform. It provides the pilot
with a live image from either the CCD (which senses light in the visible range) or the forward -looking infrared
(FLIR). The targeting pod is also capable of tracking moving targets, cueing the designator laser, and searching
for other laser designations.
The targeting pod can be selected to either the left or right DDIs, but not the central MPCD. It is selected from
the PB6 on the  TAC page with the Master M ode set to A/G or NAV.
The targeting pod camera is slewed using the TDC, when the TDC is assigned to the DDI displaying the FLIR
format. As with other formats, a small diamond appears in the top -right corner of the display when TDC is
assigned to that DDI.  TDC assignment is done using the Sensor Control Switch on the stick.
The three primary operating modes of the targeting pod are standby (STBY), air -to-ground (A/G) and air -to-air
(A/A). The FLIR format also displays when the FLIR is off, or when it is war ming up (“not timed out”).
The targeting pod’s sensor suite is mounted on a gimballed platform that can move in two directions. The sensor
platform is normally stowed when the power switch is in OFF or STBY, when the landing gear is down, and when
the airc raft is stopped on the ground. When airborne and with the targeting pod active, the sensor platform
rotates, exposing the lenses.
The sensor platform is free to rotate in two axes but is limited by obscuration from the aircraft or the rest of the
targeting  pod structure. This is true of the FLIR and CCD video, the laser target designator, and the laser spot
tracker. When the sensors are obscured by a part of the aircraft or the pod itself, the sensors are said to be

different code (or unmodulated laser emissions with no code). The code used by the LTD and the one us ed by
the LST need not be the same.   DCS [F/A-18C]

 Targeting Pod Activation
Before the targeting pod can be used, power must be applied. This is done by moving the FLIR Power switch
from OFF to either STBY or ON. After doing so, the targeting pod will enter a warm -up pe riod. During this time,
the FLIR format will display NOT TIMED OUT:



Once the warmup period is complete, if the FLIR Power switch is in STBY, the FLIR format will display STBY in
the upper -left corner, and show standby symbology:
[F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  241


When the FLIR Power s witch is in ON, OPR (operating) will display in the upper -left corner of the FLIR format,
but no video will be displayed initially:

To activate video, you must first designate an aimpoint for the targeting pod. In NAV or A/G master modes, this
can be done by designating a sensor point of interest (SPI). For example, you might use the WPDSG pushbutton
on the HSI to designate a target waypoint, or you might acquire an A/G radar lock.  When a SPI is designated,
the targeting pod will drive its LOS to that location and begin transmitting video.

Locating and Tracking Surface Targets
Once targeting pod video is available, the targeting pod LOS initially follows the SPI. When the pod is in SCENE
mode, you can use the TDC to slew targeting pod LOS awa y from the SPI, to search the surrounding area for
targets. By switching between FLIR and CCD modes using PB1, you can make concealed or camouflaged targets
more visible due to their obvious heat signature against the background. Use of FLIR mode is also n ecessary to
get usable video at night or low -light situations.
Pressing the sensor control switch right cycles between SCENE, ATRK, and PTRK track modes. ATRK is used to
track stationary vehicles and structures.
Trigger Option  Laser Type

 PTRK is used when designating moving vehicle s. The pod will attempt to maintain a track on the centroid of the
object under the crosshairs. The pod will only be able to maintain track if the object under the crosshairs stands
out from its background. If the tracked object becomes concealed, masked, or indistinguishable from the
background, the pod will enter inertial mode. In inertial mode, the pod will continue slewing according to the last
known direction and speed of the track target. If the target reappears in the vicinity of pod LOS, the pod wil l
automatically re -acquire track.
In PTRK mode, if the target centroid merges with a different moving vehicle, the pod may mistakenly switch track
to the other vehicle. When this happens, you will have to return to SCENE mode, place the cursor over the ori ginal
target, and return to PTRK mode.
In ATRK and PTRK modes, pressing the TDC shows the offset cursor. The offset cursor can be moved away from
the track target. The upper -left datablock, showing coordinates and altitude, will follow the offset cursor in stead
of the track target.

Figure 120. PTRK Mode with Offset Cursor
Designating Targets Using the Laser
The laser target designator/rangefinder (LTD/R) is a pulsed laser that is automatically aimed along pod line of
sight. In the designation role, the laser can provide a guidance solution for laser -guided munitions, both onboard
the designating aircraft and from other units; and it can train other platforms’ sensors onto the designated target.
In the range -finding role, the laser provides continuous target slant range measurements to the aircraft avionics.
To use the LTD/R, the LTD/R switch on the Sensor Control Panel must be set to ARM. When the LTD/R switch is
in ARM, PB9 cycles between laser emitters. When set to MARK, the laser designator will fire. This laser is invisible
to the eye and provides a firing solution for laser -guided munitions like the GBU -12 and AGM -65E. Normally, the
laser will fire automatically wh en designating a target, launching an AGM -65E, or dropping an LGB. Boxing the

 TRIG option (PB11) allows the laser to be controlled by the trigger. This is useful when buddy -lasing, designating
a target for another aircraft to fire upon.
When the emitter is set to PTR, the LTD/R fires an eye -safe infrared pointer. This pointer is visible at night when
wearing night -vision goggles and is used to visually point out targets. It is not capable of providing a firing solution
to laser -guided munitions.
Using Laser Spot Tracking
The Litening  pod can also detect and track laser signals emitted by other aircraft or ground units, in laser spot
track (LST) mode. In this mode, the targeting pod searches for a laser signal by a specific PRF code. When the
laser signal is detected, the pod LOS slews to the target being designated by that laser. Laser spot tracking can
by other aircraft or ground units to slew your targeting pod onto their target.
To set the PRF code that the laser spot tracker searches for, press PB14 (UFC) on the FLIR format.

Figure 121. LST Display Prior to Laser Detection
Pressing PB17 (labeled LST) commands the targeting pod into laser spot track mode. Initially, the display will be
blank and “LST” will flash in the MPCD and HUD. The pod will search for a laser designation near its LOS, so it’s
important to have the pod looking in the expected area of the target when using LST.

 Tracking Aircraft
When initially in air -to-air mode, the targeting pod LOS will be slaved to the total velocity vector (TVV) in the
HUD. You can either locate and designate targets visually, using the pod itself, or by slaving it to the radar.
Track ing Aircraft Using the Litening  II Pod
When the pod LOS is slaved to the TVV, you can visually acquire aircraft in the FLIR FOV by placing the TVV over
the aircraft. When TDC priority is on the FLIR format, pressing Castle Switch in the direction of the MP CD
displaying the FLIR format attempts a point track on a target within FLIR FOV. If point track is successful, the
operating mode will change to PTRK, and tracking gates will show on either side of the track target (see Figure
124. FLIR Air -to-Air Format (Tracking) ).
If the FLIR is tracking the wrong target, or you wish to cease tracking, pressing the VVSLV pushbutton will return
pod LOS to the TVV. While the FLIR is tracking, pressing Castle Switch in the direction of the MPCD displaying
the FLIR format again will cycle between point and area track.
Once the FLIR has a track target, pressing PB9 (SLAVE) will attempt a radar lock at the target along FLIR LOS.
Tracking Aircraft Using the Radar
When the pod is not tracking its own target (e.g., slaved to the TVV), and the radar is in a track mode (e.g., TWS
or STT), pod LOS will automatically follow the L&S target. Once you have a radar track, you can switch TDC
priority to the FLIR format, and then press the Castle Switch in the direction of the FLIR format again to command
point track. This will momentarily freeze pod LOS, so it’s recommended to wait until target LOS rate is small first.
If point track is succes sful, the operating mode will change to PTRK, and tracking gates will show on either side
of the track target (see Figure 124. FLIR Air -to-Air Format (Tracking) ).
Once p oint track is successful, you can then move TDC priority back to the radar format and change L&S targets.
The pod will continue tracking its own target until you select VVSLV or press the pinky button to command to
cage the targeting pod.

Radar Tracking Mode is the primary air -to-air gun mode of the F/A-18C. Radar Tracking Mode is obtained
immediately upon gun selection if the radar is tracking an aerial target. Valid range, range rate, and angle tracks
are required for Radar Tracking Mode operation.
Once the radar is locked on, the Target Designator (TD) indicates the position of the target being tracked, and
target range is displayed on an analog bar on the 50 -mil diameter gun reticle along with a maximum firing range
cue. Maximum gun firing range corresponds to a maximum bullet time of fl ight of 1.5 seconds and a minimum
impact velocity (bullet V C) of 500 feet per second or a minimum bullet velocity (V b) at impact of 1,000 feet per
second, whichever range is less. Maximum firing range is much greater head -on than tail -on.
An advantage of t he Radar Tracking Mode is the use of radar track data. The use of track data makes the lead
angle computation dependent only on target motion and the encounter geometry. The computed lead angle is
essentially independent of aircraft attitude. The Radar Tra cking Mode obtains firing solutions quickly since rapid
attitude changes have little short -term effect on the required lead angle. As a result, the pilot’s task is solely flying
to aim the gun reticle since the target tracking function is being performed b y the radar.
As a further aid to the pilot and for consistency with the missile modes, a SHOOT cue appears if the target is
within maximum firing range. If the predicted miss distance is less than 20 feet, and all other firing constraints
(master arm, weig ht off wheels) are satisfied, the SHOOT CUE comes on. The SHOOT cue includes a 0.5 second
anticipation needed for pilot reaction time plus gun delay time. The SHOOT cue remains on until the predicted
miss distance exceeds 30 feet.
Radar Tracking Mode is au tomatically selected if A/A GUNS is selected while there is a radar lock. If there is no
radar lock, it will go to Radar Not Tracking Mode.

 AIM-9 SIDEWINDER AIR -TO-AIR MISSILE

The AIM -9 is a short -range, infrared -guided missile best used in a dogfight. It is f ire-and-forget and can be used
with and without a sensor -slaved lock. The primary indication of a seeker lock is a higher -pitched lock tone and
the SHOOT cue. The seeker can also be uncaged to ensure the seeker is tracking the target when it has first
been sensor -slaved to the target.
Note that the AIM -9 can be decoyed by flares and it ’s a good idea to ensure you have a good seeker lock before
launching an AIM -9 with flares in the seeker field of view.
To select the AIM -9, press down on the Weapon Select Switch on the Control Stick [LShift ] + [S]. Doing so will
also automatically activate A/A Master Mode. To launch an AIM -9, press the Trigger on the Control Stick [Space] .

AIM-9 on the SMS Page
Regardless of which AIM -9 version the pilot selects, the SMS page wil l appear the same when the AIM -9 is
selected. The SMS page is accessed through the TAC menu DDI page, or it can automatically be called up by
selecting AIM -9 from the Weapon Select Switch. The selected AIM -9 on the SMS page is indicated by the SEL
indicati on above or below the station. In the case of a dual launcher, it will be indicated as either the L (left) or
R (right) rail. For example: L SEL would indicate the left rail in the indication as the priority station.
Each included AIM -9 variant has a uniqu e alpha numeric indication on the SMS page.
• CATM -9M = TST . This is a training version of the AIM -9 with an inert motor and warhead.
• AIM-9L = 9L. The first true all -aspect AIM -9 with a more sensitive seeker and limited forward quarter
engagement capability.
• AIM-9M = 9M. An improved version of the AIM -9L with improved seeker ability to detect and track
medium to low aspect targets and improved counter -counter measure capabilities.
• AIM-9X = 9X. The current version of the AIM -9 adds high off boresight capabilit y, thrust  vectoring,
high flare resistance, and  greater range.
You can cycle through all AIM -9 loaded stations with repeatedly selecting AIM -9 on the Weapon Select Switch.
Unlike the other air -to-air weapons, there are no unique AIM -9 functions on the SMS page.  Mission Practice: F/A-18C AIM-9 Sidewinder

 AIM-9 HUD
There are three primary presentations of the AIM -9 HUD:
• Not locked and no radar acquisition mode
• Not locked but in a radar acquisition mode
• Radar locked
Not Locked and No Radar  Acquisition Mode (Seeker Boresight Mode)
When the AIM -9 is selected without a radar lock and no radar acquisition mode is active, the AIM -9 seeker
boresight reticle is indicated on the HUD. To use the AIM -9 in this manner, the pilot will fly the aircraft and place
the seeker boresight reticle over an aerial target until the audio threshold is exceeded and : the angle of
coincidence is no more than 15° of aircraft boresight; and the seeker is uncaged. a high -pitched lock tone is
heard. With seeker lock acquired, pulling the trigger on the Control Stick will launch the missile.
When the AIM -9 seeker is locked  on a target, it can be uncaged by pressing the Cage/Uncage button on the
Throttles to allow the seeker lock on and follow the target within the confines of the missile seeker’s field of view.
This is a useful tool to ensure the seeker is tracking the desi red target.

 Not Locked but in Radar  Acquisition Mode
When employing the AIM -9 in close range combat, one of the radar Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) auto
acquisition modes can be u sed to lock a target and then slave the AIM -9 seeker to that target. To select the ACM
modes, press the Sensor Control Switch forward. Once in ACM mode, three ACM modes are available:
• Boresight (BST) Sensor Select switch forward
• Vertical Acquisition (VACQ)  Sensor Select switch aft
• Wide Acquisition (WACQ) Sensor Select switch  left
These are explained in greater detail in Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) Modes .
When in an ACM mode, the radar will indicate that it is in ACM mode and the specific ACM acquisition mode.
When a target is within the scan zone of the select auto acquisition mode, it will a utomatically be locked in a
Single Target Track (STT) mode and the HUD will change to the AI M-9 sensor locked target mode. Use the best
ACM acquisition mode to match the combat situation.
Please refer to the Air-to-Air Radar  chapter for an explanation of the radar ACM modes .

 Radar  Locked Mode
Upon locking a target with the AIM -9 as the priority weapon, the HUD will change to provide useful information
regarding target l ocation, weapon ranges, and other data to assist in a successful engagement. While the radar
is in Single Target Track (STT) mode, the radar range scale will automatically  be adjusted based on the range to
the locked target.
Elements of the AIM -9 HUD with radar lock include:

 AIM-7 SPARROW AIR -TO-AIR MISSILE

The AIM -7 Sparrow is a Semi -Active Radar  Homing (SARH) missile that requires the radar to be tracking the
target in Single Target Track (STT) mode the entire missile time -of-flight (Home -On-Jam being the exception).
The AIM -7 has a large warhead and can engage targets  beyond visual range as well as in close  combat . The
AIM-7 can be a deadly  missile in close  combat  when combined with the radar ACM sub modes.
The AIM -7 also has the FLOOD mode that allows it to launch and guide on a non -locked target, and it has a LOFT
option for extended range.
To select the AIM -7, push forward on the Weapon Select Switch on the CONTROL STICK [LShift ] + [W].
Selecting AIM -7 will automatically place the Master Mode in A/A.
The radar must be in Single Target Track (STT) mode to support guidance for an AIM -7. This can be done by
pressing  the Cage/Uncage button less than .8 seconds when there is an L&S target. Alternatively, you may press
right on the Sensor Control switch when the radar is on the right DDI and the target TDC is already over the
target on the radar.

FLOOD Mode
With an AIM -7 launch with no radar lock, the radar will change to FLOOD mode and use the illumination horn on
the radar to illu minate the airspace de lineated by AIM -7 ASE circle on the HUD. By flying to keep a target within
this circle, the seeker of the AIM -7 will attempt to lock on to and guide on the nearest target. This is effective
out to 10 nm.
Note that FLOOD mode forces th e AIM -7 into pure -pursuit guidance and can be very inefficient against crossing
targets. FLOOD mode is best used against very high or very low aspect targets.
FLOOD mode can be a useful mode in a dogfight when you cannot gain a radar lock.

 AIM-120 ADVANCED MEDIUM RANGE
AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE (AMRAAM)

The AIM -120 AMRAAM is an Active Radar -Homing ( ARH) air -to-air missile that can self -guide to a target using
the miniaturized -radar in its nose cone. The missile can also be guided by the F/A-18C’s radar in both Single
Target Track (STT) and Designated Track While Scan (DTWS) modes. Because of the active seeker, the F/A-18C
pilot can engage multiple targets at o nce and not be restricted to supporting the missile its entire time of flight.
The AIM -120 is a medium range missile and can engage targets outside 20 nm. However, engagement range is
highly dependent on target aspect, engagement altitude, launch speed, an d post -launch maneuvers of the target.
As such, the engagement range of the AIM -120 can be less than 10 nm in some situations.
In close range air combat, the AIM -120 can also be launched in VISUAL mode with no need of support from the
F/A-18C’s radar. Once  the missile is launched, it will seek out the first target it detects within the AIM -120 reticle
on the HUD. Be careful of friendlies!
To select the AIM -120, push right on the Weapon Select Switch on the stick [LShift ] + [D]. Selecting AIM -120
will automatically place the Maste r Mode in A/A.

 AIM-120, Radar  Tracking  Pre-Launch
With an L&S trackfile created for a target, additional engagement information  is displayed on the HUD and radar
to support an AIM -120 launch . As with the AIM -7 sensor -locked mode, this additional information includes multiple
weapon range cues, target closure and aspe ct, target range, and other information to help provide a successful
AIM-120 engagement.  The primary difference being that the AIM -120 does not require an STT lock during the
entire missile fly -out to intercept. Instead, once the AIM -120 seeker goes active , the player no longer needs to
keep a radar lock on the target.
Let’s take a look at the HUD and radar when a target has been locked  with an AIM -120 selected.


Figure  155. AIM -120 HUD with Radar Lock, Pre -Launch
1. Normalized In -Range Display (NIRD) / Allowable Steering Error (ASE) Circle . The NIRD
circle is centered on the aircraft waterline and relative range markers are displayed inside and outside
of the circle. Relative range is calculated from the 12 o ’clock position and increases clockwise. Rather
than changing in size of the NIRD/ASE circle based on target intercept changes, the Steering Dot rate
of chang e is adjusted.
2. Relative Target Range . Relative range of the target on the NIRD circle in relation to the missile
range cues.
3. Minimum Launch Range ( RMIN). Computed minimum launch range for the priority AIM -120.

9. Target Designator (TD) . This box/diamond indicate s the line of sight between the aircraft and the
locked target. If the locked target is outside the HUD field of view, the TD box flashes.
If radar tracking on the target is lost, the TD box will be hashed to indicate the radar is in memory (MEM)
mode and extrapolating  its position to reacquire it.
If the target is identified as hostile, the box is rotated 45 ° to create a diamond symbol.
Not pictured:

 AIR-TO-GROUND MARKPOINTS
In both Nav and air -to-ground mode, the F/A -18C can designate markpoints, locations on the ground which are
remembered for later use. Markpoints can be used to designate locations or targets of interest and are effectively
the same as waypoints: they can be navigated to or designated for weapons employment.
The F/A-18C can store up to nine markpoints, labeled MK1 through MK9. MK1 is used following power -on with
weight on wheels, then each subsequent markpoint designation is stored in MK2, MK3, and so on. After MK9 is
stored, the next markpoint designation is written t o MK1, overwriting the previously stored value.

Next Markpoint. Displays the next markpoint to be stored. Pressing this pushbutton stores a markpoint.
Current Waypoint. Shows the current waypoint. The up and down arrows cycle through waypoints. Markpoints
are placed in sequence after the last waypoint, WP59. Cycling do wn from WP0 selects MK9 and cycling up from
WP59 selects MK1.
Designating Markpoints
To designate a markpoint, press PB8 (labeled “MK#”) on the HSI format. The location will be stored in the
markpoint number that was previously shown adjacent the pushbutto n, and the markpoint number will increment
by one.
The current target designation will determine what type of markpoint is stored:
Overfly markpoint: To create an overfly markpoint (a markpoint at the current aircraft location), ensure that
there is no tar get designation on any format.

 Waypoint markpoint: To create a markpoint at the location of a waypoint, designate the waypoint by selecting
it and then boxing WYPT (PB11) on the HSI format.
Air-to-ground radar markpoint: To create a markpoint using the air -to-ground radar, slew the radar cursor
to the location you wish to mark, then press the TDC to designate it. On the HSI format, press the MK#
pushbutton to create a markpoint at that location. You can then press the pinky button to undesignate the radar
target.
Targeting pod markpoint: To create a markpoint using the targeting pod, slew the pod LOS to the location
you wish to mark, then press the TDC to designate it. On the HSI format, press the MK# pushbutton to create a
markpoint at that location. You ca n then press the pinky button to undesignate the FLIR target.
Getting Markpoint Coordinates
You may need to relay the coordinates of a markpoint to other players, e.g., if you locate and mark a target that
you need assistance destroying.

You can retrieve markpoint coordinates the same way you retrieve waypoint coordinates. From the HSI format,
press PB10 (labeled DATA) to navigate to the data sub -view. Ensure that PB7 (labeled WYPT) is boxed and us e
the up/down arrows (PB12 and 13) to navigate to the markpoint. (Remember, the markpoints are stored after
WP59 and before WP0.)
Once the proper markpoint is selected, the latitude, longitude, MGRS coordinates, and elevation will be shown
on the data page . You can box PRECISE (PB19) to display more precise coordinate data.

o INST (Instantaneous)
o DLY1 (Delay 1)
o DLY2 (Delay 2)
• DRAG
o FF (Free Fall)
o RET (Retarded)
Bomb Fuze Settings. Different types of bombs require different MFUZ and EFUZ settings. In the current early
access, the following should be used:
General Purpose Bombs (Mk -80 series ):
• MFUZE = NOSE
• EFUZ = INST
Canister Munitions (CBU and Mk -20)
• MFUZE = VT
• HT to 1500
• EFUZ = INS T
Laser and GPS Guided ( GBU series)
• MFUZE = OFF
• EFUZ = INST or DLY1
HT Option . The Mk-20, CBU-99, and CBU -100 canister weapons default to  using FMU-140 fuses. This is a fixed -
setting fuse with an arming time of 1.2 seconds after release.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  311

 When MFUZ is set to VT though, the HT (height) setting is available. Successive presses of the HT pushbutton
cycle through the possible Height of Burst (HOB) settings.
UFC Op tions
When the UFC pushbutton is selected from the right side the SMS page, bomb program parameters are displayed
on the UFC.

Figure 161. UFC Bomb Settings
By pressing an Option Select Key on the UFC, you can select the bomb program parameter to enter. The selected
parameter is indicated by the colon ( “:”) next to the indicator of:
• Quantity (QTY) . Number of bombs to release, ranging from 1 to 30. When more than one bomb is
selected, you must hold t he Weapon Release Button down until all bombs in the salvo are released.
• Multiples (MULT) . Number of bombs to be released simultaneously from the weapon stations in
each salvo
• Interval (INT) . The ground impact spacing in feet when in AUTO, FD, and CCIP mod es, but
milliseconds when on MAN mode.
After each value is entered using the UFC keypad, the ENTER button on the UFC must be pressed to save the
value to the program. Once saved, the value is displayed on the Program Data for the selected program (1 to 5).
Another possible UFC option is the Reticle (RTCL) option. When displayed, you may enter a value in milliradians

 AIR-TO-GROUND BOMBING HUD
The HUD has three weapon delivery modes:
• Continuously Computed Impact Point (CCIP)
• Automatic (AUTO)
• Manual  (MAN)
Unguided CCIP Bombing Mode HUD


The CCIP  mode is a computed visual delivery mode with manual weapon release. This mode allows a high degree
of flexibility since the point on the ground at which the weapon will impact is continuously indicated by a CCIP
Bombing Cross on the HUD. No target designa tion is required. In essence, place the thing on the thing and drop
the bomb.
To use, fly to place the CCIP bombing cross over the intended target and hold the Weapon Release Button down
(pickle button). A Displayed Impact Line (DIL) is also on the HUD bet ween the CCIP bombing cross and the
velocity vector. The pickle button must be held down until all bombs have been released as part of the program.
After bomb release, the Time to Impact  (TTI) is presented on the HUD as the Time of Fall  (TOF).
If the CCIP impact point does not lay within the HUD field of view, the CCIP Reflected Cue is shown as a short,
horizonal line on the DIL instead of the CCIP Bombing Cross. The cue is displaced to the same distance above
the bottom of the DIL as the computed position of the CCIP Bombing Cross is below the HUD limit.

 Automatic (AUTO) Bombing Mode HUD

The AUTO mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs. It computes release solutions for dive, dive
toss, level, and low angle lofts up to 45°. This mode requires a ground designation point from which to build the
bombing solution. Command steering i s provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will
release automatically at the proper time such that the weapons hit the target.
To calculate a bombing solution in AUTO  mode, a target first must be designated.  This can be done by:
• Flying to place the HUD reticle pipper over the target and designate it with the TDC button.
• Designating a waypoint location as the target as set on the H SI using the WPDSG option.

AUTO HUD Designation
The Mission Computer (MC) provides an Azimuth Steering Line (ASL) to provide steering to the designated target.
Designation is accomplished pressing and holding the Weapon Rel ease Button when the HUD Reticle is over the
target. By placing the Velocity Vector on the ASL and holding down the Weapon Release Button, the weapon will
release at the proper time and account for wind.

 High Drag (HD) Bomb Delivery
The F/A-18C has the option to delivery high drag bombs that either use a ballute chute or fold -out brakes. This
allows the bomb to fall well behind the aircraft when dropped at low -altitudes and fast airspeeds. In addition to
the high -drag option, these bombs also have “slick” options that allow them to behave as standard  free-fall
bombs. The  F/A-18C’s high drag bombs include:
• Mk-82 Snake Eye, that is a Mk -82, 500 -pound class bomb  that has the option for four, fold -out
airbrakes to slow the weapon. The SMS code is 82XT.
• MK-82 with BSU -49 ballute is a Mk -82, 500-pound class  bomb that uses an inflatable bag that retards
the weapon. It SMS code is 82YT.
High drag weapons can be delivered in CCIP, AUTO, and MAN modes.
SMS Set Up
Upon selecting a high drag bomb:
1. Set delivery MODE
2. Set MFUZE to NOSE
3. Set EFUZ to INST
4. Set DRAG to FF  for free fall or RET for high drag
When DRAG is set to RET, guidelines for an accurate delivery are as follows:
• Ensure that aircraft barometric pressure altimeter match the mission
• Level flight between 300 to 500 feet AGL
• Maintain flight path marker on or  just above the horizon line on the HUD.  Letting it dip below  the
horizon line will result in a Break X.
• Airspeed above  450 knots  [F/A-18C] DCS

 JHMCS AIR -TO-GROUND MODE
The Joint Helmet -Mounted Cueing System can be used in air -to-ground mode to visually designate targets within
the pilot’s line -of-sight. To use the JHMCS in air -to-ground mode, first put the aircraft in A/G Master Mode and
verify that the HMD knob is turned up. Then press Castle Switch Forward to move TDC priority to the HMD and
HUD.
When the JHMCS is on, Castle Switch forward assigns the TDC to either the HMD or the HUD. TDC assignment
then automatically switches  between the HMD and the HUD until the TDC is assigned to an MFD. When the pilot
LOS is within the HMD blanking area (in other wo rds, generally looking forward towards the HUD), TDC
assignment moves to the HUD. When the pilot LOS is outside of the HMD blanking area, TDC assignment moves
to the HMD. This is true regardless of whether HMD blanking is turned on or off.
When the TDC is assigned to the HUD, the TVV appears with a dot in the center:

When the pilot’s LOS moves away from the HUD, TDC priority jumps to the HMD, and an aiming reticle appears
on the HMD:

Figure 170. JHMCS A/G Mode, No Designation
The aiming reticle appears if a) the aircraft is in A/G Master Mode, b) the JHMCS is powered on, c) the pil ot LOS
is outside the HMD blanking area, and d) there is no current designation.
DCS [F/A-18C]

 With the aiming reticle visible, pressing TDC Designate creates a designation  at pilot line -of-sight. The mission
computer calculates best altitude above target (BAAT) to plac e the TDC on the surface of the earth.

Figure 171. JHMCS A/G Mode, Designation
A designation diamond will appear on the surface at the designated location. If the targeting pod is active, pod
LOS will automatically slew to the designation LOS. The aiming reticle will change to a smaller cross; a dot will
appear in the center of the cross if the HMD still has TDC priority.
The designation diamond will have a segmente d outline if no -action slew is available; in other words, if the pilot
can refine the designation using the TDC immediately. If the designation  cannot be slewed (e.g., the FLIR is in a

 LASER -GUIDED BOMBING

Delivery of laser -guided bombs can be conducted in CCIP, AUTO, and MAN modes, but AUTO mode is preferable
as it allows delivery while in level flight. Laser -guided bombs should be released at greater than 8,000 feet AGL
to give enough time for laser designation capture and guidance.
Two general types of laser -guided bomb units (GBU) can be loaded on the F/A-18C:
• Paveway II series: GBU -10, GBU -12, and GBU -16
• Paveway III series: GBU -24B/B

Paveway II series bombs are displayed on the wingform as conventional bombs are. The only difference is that
a four -digit laser code is displayed below the weapon code. All Paveway II series b ombs show the same code if
a Paveway II series bomb  is not first selected. If a Paveway II series bomb is selected, the code is just be applied
to the priority station bomb. This allows you to set separate laser codes for each bomb.
If an LGB is detected a s being loaded on the aircraft, the CODE pushbutton will be present on the SMS page at
pushbutton 1.
The default laser code is XXXX. To change the code, the CODE legend at pushbutton 1 is pressed when a Paveway
II series bomb is already selected. Upon doin g so, the bottom Option Select Window shows CODE, and the keypad
can be used to enter a four -digit code. Once CODE is colonized, this code should match the designation from a

Paveway III Series
The Paveway III -series of laser -guided bombs introduces further enhancements over the Paveway I and Paveway
II weapons.  Most notably, Paveway III guidance kits eschew traditional “bang -bang” guidance (where the control
fins are only fully deflected in one direction or the other) for proportional deflection, where the control fins can
move in increments to steer the bomb, g iving the bomb longer range. The Paveway III electronics also gives the
bomb more guidance capability, which is reflected in updated avionics controls. The GBU -24 is the Paveway III
variant with a 2,000 -pound warhead (equivalent to a Mk. 84).
The Paveway I II computes a launch acceptability region (computed LAR or CLAR). If the bomb is dropped within
this region, it can maneuver onto a target that is being lased. To compute the LAR, the Paveway III must know
the approximate location of the target being lased  (for example, co -located with a designated waypoint). The
Paveway III can calculate a “straight -line” LAR, a LAR that assumes the aircraft flies a straight line from its present
location directly to the target; or it can calculate a “pre -planned” LAR, whi ch assumes the pilot attacks the target
from a pre -determined heading.

 A strong crosswind can have an unanticipated effect on the LAR. In a crosswind, the aircraft must crab into the
wind to maintain a straight ground track to the target. This points the bomb’s seeker he ad upwind. This forces
the LAR to shift upwind, even though after release the bomb will drift downwind. In sufficiently strong crosswinds,
flying the ASL may never result in the aircraft penetrating the LAR.  DCS [F/A-18C]

high-speed launches. They offer excellent ac curacy with launch -and-leave capability.
Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)  is a low -drag general -purpose bomb  fixed with an attached JDAM
guidance kit. Guidance is obtained by an onboard  Inertial Navigation System (INS)  aided by a  Global Positioning
System (GPS)  processor. The JDAM guidance kit provides accurate guidance in all -weather conditions, day or
night. JDAM is a programmable system that allows multiple weapons to be independently targeted prior to
release. Targeting data are entered as lat/long/a lt coordinates and are provided to the weapon by the pilot via
the avionic interfaces.  For the most accurate programming , precise hour:minute:second  to hundredth of a second

Weapon Selection
Upon initial weapon selection and timing is complete (after 2:30), all currently inventoried weapons of the same
variant are placed into STBY (standby) status as indicated under their respective weapon acronyms. All weapons
simultaneously begin alignment and will remain initialized if at least one weapon station of the same type is
selected.
Deselecting JDAM/JSOW will likewise cause all weapons of the same type to spin down, requiring at least 2.5
minutes for warmup to complete again. Consideration should therefore be given to this warmup cycle when
mission planning. The status of this alignment cycle is indicated on the  STORES format  and JDAM/JSOW
displays  as a TIMING cue which is initialized to 10:00 minutes and counts down. The TIMING cue is removed
when the Time -to-Go (TTG) reaches 7:30 (alignment is GOOD after 2:30).
When a GPS weapon is initially selected,  all stations of the same store type are simultaneously placed in STBY
until the TIMING cue is removed, at  which point the priority station will either remain in STBY or transition to
RDY (ready), depending on A/G Ready status ( i.e., warmup complete, designation exists and is valid). All INS-GPS Weapon in TOO Mode

As with other A/G stores, all GPS weapons including JSOW and JDAM may be selected in NAV or A/G master
modes by boxing the applicable weapon acronym from weapon selection menu across the top row of push buttons
from the STORES planform format.
JDAM and JSOW versions are listed as follows on the JDAM format page:
• J-109 = GBU-31(V)4/B
• J-84 = GBU -31(V)2/B
• J-83 = GBU -32(V)2/B
• J-82 = GBU -38 (need s BRU-55A/A)
• JSA = AGM -154A
• JSC = AGM -154C
Selection of any GPS weapon on the STORES format applie s power to every inventoried GPS weapon of the same
type. Power remains applied to the GPS weapons until deselected. A GPS variant is deselected only when the
associated weapon select option is unboxed explicitly, or another weapon type is selected. When o perational
power is first applied, warm -up and transfer alignment begin. As soon as warmup is complete (2.5 minutes from
initial power up), the weapon may be armed for release. Note that the alignment quality is not a prerequisite for
release interlocks an d achieving an alignment quality of GOOD may take as long as 10 minutes.

Weapon Station/Status . The priority station is boxed when selected and is the station which is currently
accepting targeting data. The station status  cue represents the statu s or health of the station.
• Priority Station . Selecting a PP# mission option (or TOO) assigns that mission (or TOO) to that
specific station. Subsequently changing the priority station will load any previously selected mission
for that station. For example , station 3 may be assigned to mission PP2 and station 9 may be
assigned to mission PP1.
• Station Status Cue . Displayed below each station on the wing planform is the station status. When
any single GPS weapon is selected, all stations with the same variant  are automatically places into
standby. Only the priority station is boxed, but a STBY status is displayed at each useable station
unless overridden by a  higher priority status (e.g., SFAIL or WFAIL). If the status of any weapon in
the quantity changes, th e status reflects the change, but the weapon remains in the quantity.
ALN QUAL . Indicates the priority station navigational state. This is the state of the weapon ’s internal guidance
alignment status. Weapon INS alignment quality takes time to improve. Thi s cue consists of a numeric value from
01 (best) to 10 (worst) and a plain language cue of UNST, MARG or GOOD. All weapons initialize in the 10 UNST
state.

 • ARM. The weapon is armed, but not necessarily RDY
• SIM. The weapon is disarmed, in Simulation  (SIM) mode. When simulation mode is selected, SIM is
displayed  in this location in place of SAFE or ARM
STEP Option . Provided when the SMS determines that more than one weapon of the selected type is available
for release and the quantity  is greater than 1. Each successive depression of the STEP option causes the SMS to
change the priority station indication to the next available station in the station priority sequence. If a release
quantity of more than one is selected for a given convention al, laser -guided, or GPS -guided bomb, the SMS will
automatically step to the next available priority station before releasing the next weapon in the salvo. The first
weapon released in a quantity release is always from the station which is currently select ed. The priority station
the SMS chooses in quantity releases is prioritized based on loading priority to reduce to a minimum the lateral
moments created by asymmetrical loads. For example, if a weapon is released from an outer wing pylon, the
SMS will sel ect the matching opposite pylon (if available) for the next station in the priority sequence.
Range Status . The Range Status cues refer to the weapon  at the priority station:
• ## TMR . If the aircraft is outside the Launch Acceptability Region (LAR) and the target is within the
forward hemisphere of the aircraft, this cue will read  ## TMR  indicating the time in seconds (99
max) until the aircraft is within the maximum range of the weapon at the current (no launch zone
specified), or reference (LZ specified) altitude.
• IN RNG . If the aircraft is within the aerodynamic range of the weapon, but is not yet within the LAR,
IN RNG will be displayed here. Generally speaking, and at least in terms of the current simulation, IN
RNG will be transient, as IN Z ONE will occur almost immediately following IN RNG.
• IN ZONE . This cue indicates  the aircraft is within the LAR and the weapon should be released.
A/G Ready . When a weapon of any type other than the gun is selected , the corresponding A/G menu acronym
will be boxed just as it is under the individual stations. The status for the weapon is also echoed here. Pressing
a boxed weapon option will deselect that weapon and select no weapon. Likewise, selecting an unboxed weapon
will select that weapon, and the SMS wi ll automatically provide the selected station based on the priority
sequencing algorithm.
Fuzing Status . The EFUZ or MFUZ fuze status due indicates  the armed or safe status of the fuzes for the selected
JDAM. [F/A-18C] DCS

 AGM-65 MAVERICK

The F/A-18C can carry two versions of the AGM -65 Maverick air -to-ground missile: a laser guided version (AGM -
65E) and the infrared guided AGM -65F. These missiles are carried on the LAU -117A(V)2/A single rail launcher,
which is attached directly to the BRU -32/A racks on wing station s 2, 3, 7, and 8. The  F/A-18C does not support
multiple carriage of AGM -65s on a single station.
• AGM-65E Laser Maverick: This is a 641 -pound missile containing a laser -guidance system and solid
fuel rocket motor. The guidance system automatically locks -on and tracks targets being illuminated
by a properly coded laser illuminator (from a targeting pod or JTAC). For this example, we will use
JTAC laser designation.
• AGM-65F IR Maverick: This is a 675 -pound missile containing an infrared detector system and sol id
fuel rocket motor. The missiles provide infrared raster video to allow lock -on and tracking of targets
which provide sufficient temperature contrast.
These Mavericks are automatically displayed on the Stores Management System page when a Maverick weapon

 AGM-65E Format and Setting Laser Codes
From the laser Maverick format page, it is possible to enter laser codes for the Laser Mavericks, the Laser Spot
Tracker, and the Las er Target Designator/Ranger using the UFC option. The laser codes are displayed on the
wingform below the weapon wingform. when “UFC” is selected from the Stores format, all of the laser codes are
boxed, and a single code may be entered for all laser stati ons using the UFC scratchpad, or the selected station
may be cycled through the laser stations using the UFC option on the display (Sequence = all stations, 2, 3, 4,
6, 7, 8, all stations, 2, 3, etc.).
Depression of “ENTER” on the UFC enters a valid laser code if one was in the scratchpad and boxes the laser
code(s) for the next laser station(s) in the sequence.
From the Laser Maverick format, it is possible to enter laser codes for all four Laser Mavericks using the UFC
option. The laser codes can be displ ayed in a list on the right side of the format, with each Laser Maverick station
and its associated code. When “UFC” is selected from the Laser Maverick format, all of the laser codes are boxed,
and a single code can be entered for all laser stations using  the UFC scratchpad, or the selected station can be
cycled through the Laser Maverick stations using the UFC option on the display. Depression of “ENTER” on the
UFC will enter a valid laser code if one was in the scratchpad and will box the laser code(s) f or the next laser
station(s) in the sequence.
How to Launch an AGM -65E
At aircraft start -up the SMS applies power to all Laser Maverick weapon  stations. When the Laser Maverick is
selected in A/G master mode, the SMS automatically selects the first available weapon in the station priority
sequence. (The priority station sequence is 8, 2, 7, 3). At the same time the SMS commands gyro spin -up of a ll
available Laser Maverick missiles. After a 5 -second delay, the SMS provides the code data to all Laser Ma vericks
aboard by simultaneously selecting each Laser Maverick station and applying the code signals to the weapon.
When a designation does not exis t, the selected weapon is initially caged, and the caged status is indicated at
the upper right corner of the display. The priority station selected, and the Laser Maverick launcher timing
indication are displayed in the upper left corner of the display. W hen time -out is complete (after 30 seconds),
the” TIMING ##” indication disappears.
When the Laser Maverick is placed into the scan mode by assigning the TDC to the Laser Maverick and depressing
and releasing the TDC or uncaging the missile [C]. The SMS th en provides both the uncage and slew enable
commands to the selected weapon. While the TDC is depressed, forces may be applied to the TDC to adjust the
azimuth and/or elevation angle at which the Laser Maverick is scanning. When the Laser Maverick is uncag ed
and the cage/uncage switch on the throttle is depressed, the SMS applies the uncage command to the Maverick
launcher which results in caging the selected weapon. The weapon must then have the slew or slave command
applied to enable scan or slave mode, a nd subsequent lock -on.
The HUD format indicating a Laser Maverick selected in A/G mode is shown above. This format includes the
triangle symbol which indicates the Maverick LOS. The symbol sweeps back and forth across the HUD when the
Maverick is scanning and is limited at the HUD FOV limits and flashed when the Maverick LOS exceeds these
limits. A/G ready is indicated on the HUD by the absence of the “X” through the MAV acronym.
The Laser Maverick automatically locks onto a target illuminated with a correc tly coded laser from scan and slew
modes. If the missile is caged at boresight, the gimbal angle “X” will flash indicating that the seeker senses
correctly coded laser energy. The TDC must be depressed, uncage signal applied, sensor control switch moved,
or a target designated to lock on (these commands slew, which allows lock -on). The gimbal angle symbol on the
Laser Maverick format is replaced by a solid square, as shown above, to indicate lock -on. Also, MAV LKD will be
displayed on the right side of the HUD. The aircraft is maneuvered to satisfy the launch constraint and in -range
criteria and the weapon release button is depressed for launch of the Maverick.  DCS [F/A-18C]

 TIMING Cue . When the infrared Maverick weapon is selected, the SMS a pplies power (AGM -65 Select signal) to
all LAU -117A(V)2/A launchers attached to IR Mavericks and provides a timing signal to the MC for display on the
Maverick format. To ensure that the IR Maverick is ready for launch , the SMS sends a 3 -minute countdown t imer
to the MC, which is displayed as an advisory cue, “TIMING ## ”. The time ## decrements from 180 seconds to
allow for worst -case gyro spin -up time and is removed at 0 seconds.
Fuzing Options . Three mutually exclusive fuzing options, instantaneous (INST)  and two delay (DLL1, DLL2)
options, are selectable for IR Maverick electrical fuzing control. The selected fuzing is provided to the SMS for
electrical fuse control via the AN/ AWW -4(V) Fuse Function Control Set.
Ship Track . Selection of this option will s et the Maverick seeker guidance and control to optimize for a ship
target and offset the impact point to the ship ’s waterline. The Maverick horizontal tracking gate will widen to
twice the length of the vertical tracking gate while the Maverick is in “SHIP TRACK ” mode and is not in the TRACK
mode.
Tracking Polarity . Track polarity is indicated by the label displayed at this option. While the missile not in Track
mode, either “TRACK WHT ”, or “TRACK BLK ” may be selected. The Maverick composite video is only d isplayed in
White Hot mode. Therefore, when the display indicates “TRACK WHT ”, the missile will track on the hot (white)
target when it is commanded to track. When the format indicates “TRACKL BLK ”, the missile will track on the
cold (black) targets. The m issile will reflect the selected tracking polarity by displaying the Maverick crosshair s
and the pointing cross in either back for “TRACK BLK ” or white for “TRACK WHT ”. The tracking polarity will initially
be set to “TRACK WHT ” (hot on cold). The TRACK option will not be displayed Forced Correlate track is selected.
Caged/Uncaged Status . The caged/uncaged status of the weapon is continuously provided on the Maverick

signal is commanded to the missile by depression of the CAGE/UNCAGE button on the right throttle , UNCAGED
is provided on the format.  The Maverick wi ll automatically uncage if the TDC is depressed or if a waypoint is
designated as a target.
Station Step (STEP)  -This option is provided when the SMS determines that weapons of the selected type are
available for release from more than one weapon  station. Each successive selection of the STEP option causes
the SMS to change the priority station indication to the ne xt available station in the normal station priority
sequence which contains the selected weapon. The station priority sequence for the Laser Maverick is 8, 2, 7, 3.
Field  of View . The IR Maverick will place four corner brackets within the wide FOV indicati ng what area will be

 AGM-65F Infrared Maverick Targeting
With the TDC assigned to the Maverick format  page, the seeker may be slewed within the gimbal limits of the
seeker. This can be done in one of two wa ys based on the selection of the Options / Special Tab / F/A-18C:
Realistic TDC Slew option.

Figure 197. OPTIONS/SPECIAL TDC Slew
• Realistic TDC Slew Option Enabled . To slew the seeker with the TDC, the TDC must be
depressed [Enter]  while at the same time slewing  the seeker [,], [.], [/], and [;]. Slew the
crosshair s in the center of the display over the desired target and release the TDC switch depress to
command a lock of the target. If successful, the crosshair s will collapse around the target and track it
in stabilized mode. If unsuccessful, the seeker will not lock and go to break lock mode in which the
crosshair s expand.
• Realistic TDC Slew Option Disabled .  Some  controllers may have difficulty recognizing multiple
inputs at once. If you have trouble with the realistic option, please disable it and try this. Instead of
requiring the TDC to be depressed while slewing the seeker, you can instead simply slew the seek er
with [,], [.], [/], and [;] with no  TDC depress. Slew the center of the crosshair s over the desired
target and cease slew movement. Wait up to two seconds to allow the seeker to lock on to the
target. If successful, the crosshair s will collapse around t he target. If unsuccessful, the crosshair s will
expand out.
When slewing the seeker, the center of the vertical horizontal bars ( crosshair ) marks the location where the
seeker will attempt to lock a target. When slewed  off boresight, the pointing cross pro vides a reference of the
seeker line of sight offset from boresight.

Pointing Cross . The seeker position will be indicated by a small pointing cross. The pointing cross position
relative to the large crosshair s will indicate the seeker  position. Relative to missile boresight the tick marks along
the vertical crosshair  are spaced by 5 °, thereby indicating the depression angle and the scale. When the IR
Maverick is in track and either the target is not within the launch constraint window or the tracking performance
is poor, the small pointing cross will flash. A steady pointing cross will ind icate a good lock.
Slave Maverick to Target (TG)
In addition to manually slewing the seeker to locate and lock onto a target, the seeker may also be slaved to a
target (TGT). This could be a waypoint designated target (WPDSG) or a target created with a sen sor. With a TGT
created, the Maverick seeker will automatically uncage and slew to the target location. To slew the seeker away
from the designated target location, pr ess the Undesignate  [S] button  to allow manual  slew.

 AGM-88 HARM
The AGM -88C High -Speed Anti -Radiation Missile (HARM) is an air -launched weapon that homes in on and destroys
radar emitters. This is most often used to suppress and destroy Surface -to-Air Missile (SAM) units to allow other
air units to enter a contested area. The HARM replaced the older AGM -45 Shrike with faster speed, longer range,
a larger warhead, and more capable guidance.
The HARM can fly at speeds exceeding Mach 2 by means of low -smoke solid rocket booster. Depending on the
launch altitude, the HARM can reach  targets out to 80 nm. Behind the Texas Instruments passive seeker is a
WDU-21/B blast fragmentation warhead. The warhead is armed with a proximity device that allows the warhead
to detonate near the radar antenna dish to increase the fragmentation area.
The HARM can be employed in three modes:
• Self-Protection (SP) with Pull Back option
• Target of Opportunity (TOO)
• Pre-Briefed (PB)
Loading
The HARM is suspended from the LAU -118/A launch rail, which is connected to BRU -32/A pylons. Four HARMs
can be loaded on stations  2, 3, 7, and 8.
HOTAS
Momentary pushbutton switch which controls the forward looking infrared (FLIR) field of view (FOV). Switch

Notes
• Because the HARM has no ranging capability and is not slewed with another sensor in SP mode,
there is no range to target provided.
• The HARM is best used at 30,000 feet AGL and above to maximize range.
• If the targeted radar turns off, the H ARM will lose guidance and will likely not hit the target.

 Pre-Briefed (PB) Mode


Pre-briefed mode is used when the location of the enemy emitter is known, and a waypoint has been placed in
the vicinity of that location. In pre -briefed mode, the missile will loft and fly to the location of the emitter, then
turn on its receiver and home on the target.
Activate pre -briefed mode by boxing “PB” (pushbutton 3) on the HARM format. The pre -briefed mode symbology
will be displayed.  Weapons Practice - AGM-88C HARM

How to Employ the AGM -88C HARM in P B Mode
1. Master Arm to ARM and Master Mode switch to A/G
2. Select HARM from the SMS page
3. Box “PB” on the HARM format to enable PB mode (pushbutton 3)
4. Press “UFC” on the HARM format (PB 14).

Pullup Mode.  When “HRM” is boxed, the HARM will do all maneuvering (including lofting) to reach the target.
The aircraft will have to be close  enough that the HARM will have sufficient energy to do all the necessary
maneuvering. When “A/C” is boxed, it is expected that the pilot will perform the loft maneuver, increasing the
HARM’s range.
In-Range Indication.  Displays “A/C RNG” when the aircraft  is in-range for an A/C pullup shot. Displays “HRM
RNG” when the aircraft is in -range for a HARM pullup shot.
Timers.  The top line displays the time -of-flight of the next HARM, if launched now. The second line displays the
time-to-impact of the in -flight H ARM. The bottom line displays the difference between the two; in other words,
how much later the second impact would be after the first.
UFC. Pressing this pushbutton allows the pilot to set the emitter type on the UFC.

 AGM-84D HARPOON
The AGM -84D Harpoon is the primary anti -ship weapon for the F/A-18C. It is a big, heavy weapon with a large
warhead, sophisticated guidance system, and a long range. It has two primary release modes: Range / Bearing
Launch (R/BL) and Bearing Only Launch (B OL). R/BL is the most accurate of the two but requires you to know
the bearing and range to the target before firing. This is done using the SEA mode of the radar on AG mode. BOL
is a less accurate, but you only need to know the approximate bearing of the target.  For this initial release of the
Harpoon, BOL will be available. Once the SEA mode of the radar is ready, we will add R/BL mode.
The weapon release button [RAlt ] + [Space]  is used  to launch  a Harpoon.
Harpoon SMS Format
Upon selection of the AGM-84D Harpoon from the top row of the SMS page, the Harpoon format page is displayed .
Options this page will vary based on BOL or R/BL mode and if a Harpoon Turnpoint (HPTP) is used.


Figure  217. Harpoon Main Page
The unique and primary functions of the page are:
Weapon Select.  Harpoons are listed as HPD and will first have a 20 -second TIMING cue when first selected.
Once the 20 -second count -down has expired, RDY is displayed below the HPD indication . Prior to being  ready,
the boxed HPS will have an X through it.
Delivery MODE.  There are two modes that the Harpoon cane be fired in:
Weapon Select  Harpoon Turnpoint  (HPTP)
Delivery Mode
Flight Profile (FLT)
Terminal Modes (TERM)  Fixed Point (FXP)
Station STEP
UFC Options
Weapon Program (PROG)  DCS [F/A-18C]

384

 • BOL. Bearing Only Launch (BOL) allows the missile to be launched and fly along a set bearing and
the missile will attempt to search for ship targets according to the set criteria.
• R/BL. Range / Bearing Launch (R/BOL ) requires a ship target to first be designated (using A/G radar
SEA mode.

Flight Profile (FLT). The FLT option provides three flight profiles, HIGH, MED, and LOW. These are us ed to
change the flight profile setting.
• HIGH: The Harpoon cruises to the target at high altitude. A high -altitude profile provides the
maximum range for the weapon and increases the effective search area of the seeker; however, the
weapon is detectable at  longer range and more susceptible to countermeasures. Cruise altitude is
35,000 feet.
• MED: The Harpoon cruises to the target at medium altitude. Medium altitude provides a compromise
between the HIGH and LOW profiles. Maximum range and search area is grea ter than LOW, but less
than HIGH. Similarly, enemy detection typically occurs later than HIGH, but sooner than LOW. Cruise
altitude is 15,000 feet.
• LOW: The Harpoon cruises to the target at low (sea skimming) altitude. Low altitude is also known as
a sea s kimming profile because the Harpoon travels to the target area at very low altitude. While
maximum range is reduced, enemy reaction time is also greatly reduced. Cruise altitude is 5,000 feet.
Terminal Mode s (TERM). Two terminal mode options, SKIM and POP,  are available. These are used to change
the terminal mode option.
• SKIM: After acquiring a target with its onboard radar, the Harpoon flies a minimum altitude approach
to the target (25 feet).
• POP: After target acquisition, the missile commences a pop -up attack on the target. This begins at 5
nm from the target and climbs to 500 feet before diving on the target.
Seek Mode (SEEK). This is only available in R/BL mode  and not pictured above. Upon  pressing SEEK, three
options are presented that determine when t he seeker begins searching for the target  at the designated location:
• SML. 10,000 meters before target location
• MED. 20,000 meters before target location
• LRG. 30,000 meters before target location
o LEFT
o RIGHT
o NORM
o NEAR
o FAR
This will offset the search based on the selection.
Harpoon Turnpoint  (HPTP) . Allows the selection of a waypoint or markpoint to be used as an intermediate
turnpoint  between ownship and the target/search area. With a turnpoint  selected, the Harpoon will first fly to the
turnpoint , then turn towards the final bearing (BOL), or target (R/BL). Boxing the HPTP option copies the currently
selected (via HSI) waypoint/markpoint into the selected Harpoon delivery program. To change the turnpoint , the
HPTP option is unboxed, the waypoint is changed via the HSI, and then the HPTP option is re -boxed. The HPTP
option is applicable to both the R/BL and BOL modes, however in BOL mode, the search distance becomes relative
to the turnpoint  rather than ow nship. If a HPTP is selected in BOL mode, the Fixed -point option is blanked, since
the two modes are incompatible.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  385

 Fixed -Point (FXP) . The Fixpoint option allows the ability to fix the search pattern of the BOL mode about a
NAV stabilized mid -point. The mid -point is located halfway between the search and destruct ranges. This
essentially creates a fixed derived “target” area allowing multiple Harpoons to be deployed into the same area
without an actual designated target. The fixpoint option is not available when a turnpoint (HPTP) is selected.
Station STEP. Actuation of the Step PB cycles through loaded Harpoons on the wing stations. A selected and
TIMED Harpoon will have its HPD label boxed on the wingform with RDY below. Non -selected stations are not
boxed and have STBY below.
Weapon Program ( PROG ). This option cycles between the available programs in sequence. You can modify
the current program by using the MODE, FLT, TERM, SEEK, SRCH , and BRG settings. There can be up to five
programs and each Harpoon can be set to a different program.
TTMR.  The Time to Maximum Range (TTMR) is displayed only in R/BL mode when the target is locked and
indicates time remaining until the target will be at maximum launch  range. When target is within maximum range,
the TTMR is r eplaced with IN ZONE. This is displayed in the top left corner of the Harpoon format page.
UFC Options

Figure 218. Harpoon UFC Options
Active Search Range (SRCH): (BOL mode only) This option adjust s the range from the launch point that the
Harpoon begins its active search. To adjust, the player will press the UFC pushbutton and then select the SRCH
button on the UFC. The player can then enter a value on the keypad and then press the UFC ENT button t o save
it. Valid search range is from 0 to 105 nm.
Missile Destruct Range (DSTR) . Upon selection from the UFC Option Select Window, the player can enter a
range in nautical miles on the keypad to determine when the Harpoon will self -destruct. Valid range i s from the
entered search range plus 172 nm.
Flight Bearing (BRG):  (BOL mode only). As with the SRCH function, the player  will select the BRG option on
the UFC. The magnetic or true bearing relative to ownship that the Harpoon will launch along. If a Harpo on
Turnpoint (HPTP) is selected, the bearing will be relative to the turnpoint. If Fixpoint (FXP) is selected, the BRG
will become irrelevant. Valid bearing is 0 to 359.

 AGM-84E STAND -OFF LAND ATTACK
MISSILE (SLAM)
The AGM -84E SLAM is a derivative of the AGM -84D Harpoon anti -ship missile that is designed for precision attack
against fixed ground locations. It is a sub -sonic (0.7 Mach) cruise missile with an operational range of 50 miles
that uses INS and GPS navigati on. It is armed with the same warhead as in a Tomahawk land attack missile
(TLAM). Like the AGM -62 Walleye that preceded it, it interfaces with the AN/AWW -13 datalink  pod that allows
live video from its AGM -65F seeker to be transmitted to the pilot while t he missile is in flight. Using the TDC slew
control, the pilot can fly the missile to the target with pinpoint accuracy. Like other GPS -guided weapons of the
F/A-18C, the SLAM can be launched in both Pre -Planned (PP) and Target of Opportunity (TOO) modes.
The AN/AWW -13 Advanced Datalink  Pod is used to communicate with the SLAM. It allows for guidance of the
SLAM seeker after it has been launched by transmitting and receiving post -launch slew and lock -on commands.
The AN/AWW -13 provides man -in-the-loop guida nce.
The weapon release button [RAlt] + [Space]  is used to launch a SLAM.
Weapon Selection
Upon initial weapon selection and timing is complete (2:30), all currently inventoried weapons of the same variant
are placed into STBY (standby) status as indicated  under their respective weapon acronyms. All weapons
simultaneously begin warming up and will remain initialized if at least one weapon station of the same type is
selected.
Deselecting SLAM will likewise cause all weapons of the same type to spin down, re quiring at least 2.5 minutes
for warmup to complete again. Consideration should therefore be given to this warmup cycle when mission
planning. The status of this warmup cycle is indicated on the  STORES and SLAM formats  as a TIMING cue which
is initialized to 10:00 minutes and counts down. The TIMING cue is removed when the Time -to-Go (TTG) reaches
7:30 (warmup complete after 2:30).
When a GPS weapon is initially selected,  all stations of the same store type are simultaneously placed in STBY
until the TIMING  cue is removed, at which point the priority station will either remain in STBY or transition to
RDY (ready), depending on A/G Ready status (e.g., warmup complete, designation exists and is valid). All
additional stores of the same type will remain in STBY  until selected (RDY cue), explicitly deselected, or indirectly
deselected by the selection of a different weapon type or upon transition to A/A master mode.
SLAM Stores Format
As with other A/G stores, all GPS weapons including SLAM may be selected in NAV  or A/G master modes by
boxing the applicable weapon acronym from weapon selection menu across the top row of push buttons from
the STORES planform format. It should be possible to program SLAM while on the ground with master arm to
SAFE and in NAV master mode.
SLAM is listed as SLAM
Selection of any GPS weapon on the STORES format applies power to every inventoried GPS weapon of the same
type. Power remains applied to the GPS weapons until deselected. A GPS variant is deselected only when the
associated we apon select option is unboxed explicitly, or another weapon type is selected. When operational
power is first applied, warm -up and transfer alignment begin. As soon as warmup is complete (2.5 minutes from
initial power up), the weapon may be armed for rele ase. Note that the alignment quality is not a prerequisite for
release interlocks and achieving an alignment quality of GOOD may take as long as 10 minutes.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  389

 SLAM and Datalink  SMS Page
Because of the possible combination s of loading SLAM and the AN/AWW -13 datalink  pod, there are three possible
format pages. These formats replace the standard wingform format when selected.
• Only datalink  pod
• Only SLAM
• Both datalink  pod and SLAM
From the TAC page SLAM DSPLY is available when only at least one SLAM is loaded but  not AN/AWW -13 datalink
pod. SLAM -13 DSPLY is shown when both a SLAM and the datalink  pod are loaded, and DL13 DSPLY when only
the datalink  pod is loaded.
When both SLAM and the datalink  pod are selected, only the top 80% of the displays has video with str oke
symbology over the entire display .
AN/AWW -13 Datalink  Pod Only Selected
When the datalink  pod is selected and a SLAM is not, the top 80% of the display should be static because the
datalink  pod has not been linked to a SLAM . Elements of the datalink  only page include:

1. Weapon Selection Status.  If the AWW -13 is being used in conjunction with a SLAM, both SLAM
and DL13 should be boxed. When conditions do not permit release of a SLAM (e.g., out of LAR),
“SLAM” is crossed out.
2. Pod Antenna Option . The A ANT option selects the aft antenna of the datalink pod. It is boxed
when selected. Although it can be selected, it will have no game function.

 3. Weapon Selection . The Weapon option links the datalink  pod to the selected datalink -capable
weapon. When linked, the option is boxed.
4. TDC Assignment Indicatio n. This diamond indicates that the TDC is assigned to the display . In
order to slew the seeker head, TDC must be assigned to the DL13 format.
5. UFC Pod Channel Selection Option . This option is used to select one of the pre -set pod datalink
channels. Pressing  PB 14 displays CHNL on the top Open Select Window on the UFC. Upon colonizing
the window, the channel is entered using the keypad and ENT is pressed. If a valid channel is
entered (2, 3, 7 or 8), the channel number is listed after CH on the datalink  forma t. The channel
number will correspond to the SLAM station number.
SLAM Employment with No Datalink  Pod
When used without the AN/AWW -13 datalink  pod, the SLAM acts in a very similar manner to other INS/GPS -
guided weapons like JDAM and JSOW , in both TOO and PP modes. The terminal infrared imager cannot be used
without a datalink pod.
SLAM SMS Format with No Datalink  Pod
Upon selection of the AGM -84E SLAM from the top row of the SMS page, the SLAM format with AN/AWW -13
datalink  pod page is displayed.

The unique and primary functions of the page are:

SLAM Warmup Timer . The TIMING SLAM warmup timer cue initializes at 10:00 minutes and counts down to
7:30 when SLAM warmup is complete, at which time the cue is removed.
Flight Profile (FLT). The FLT option provides three flight profiles, HIGH, MED, and LOW. These are used to
change the flight profile setting.
• HIGH: The SLAM cruises to the target at high altitude. Cruise altitude is 35,000 feet.
• MED: The SLAM cruises to the t arget at medium altitude. Cruise altitude is 15,000 feet.
• LOW: The SLAM cruises to the target at low (sea skimming) altitude. Cruise altitude is 5,000 feet.
The default Flight Profile setting will be Medium (MED) , and the selected Flight Profile is listed in the bottom left
portion of the page.
Fuzing Status . The EFUZ or MFUZ fuze status cue indicates the armed or safe status of the fuzes for the selected
SLAM. The fuze  status is displayed in the bottom left corner of the display.
ERASE SLAM . This option immediately clears all GPS weapons of the selected variant of all previously entered
pre-planned (PP) mission data. SLAM ERASE is boxed when selected and remains boxed f or 5 seconds. SLAM
ERASE cannot be undone.
SLAM Turnpoint  (STP). Allows the selection of a waypoint or markpoint to be used as an intermediate turnpoint
between ownship and the target/search area. With a turnpoint  selected, the SLAM will first fly to the turnpoint ,
then turn towards TOO or PP target location. Boxing the STP option copies the currently selected (via HSI)
waypoint/markpoint into the selected SLAM mid -course guidance program. To change the turnpoint , the STP
option is unboxed, the waypoint is changed via the HSI, and then the STP option is re -boxed.
Station STEP.  Actuation of the Step PB cycles through loaded SLAMs on the wing stations. A selected and TIMED
SLAM will have its SLAM label boxed on the wingform with RDY below. Non -selected station s are not boxed and
have STBY below.
Range Status . The Range Status cues refer to the weapon at the priority station:
• ## TMR . If the aircraft is outside the Launch Acceptability Region (LAR) and the target is within the
forward hemisphere of the aircraft, this cue will read  ## TMR  indicating the time in seconds (99
max) until the aircraft is within the maximum range of the weapon at the current (no launch zone
specified), or reference (LZ specified) altitude.
• IN RNG . If the aircraft is within the aerodynami c range of the weapon, but is not yet within the LAR,
IN RNG will be displayed here. Generally speaking, and at least in terms of the current simulation, IN
RNG will be transient, as IN ZONE will occur almost immediately following IN RNG.
• IN ZONE . This cue  indicates the aircraft is within the LAR and the weapon should be released.
Alignment Quality . Indicates the priority station navigational state. This is the state of the weapon ’s internal
guidance alignment status. Weapon INS alignment quality takes time  to improve. This cue consists of a numeric
value from 01 (best) to 10 (worst) and a plain language cue of UNST, MARG or GOOD. All weapons initialize in

 Seeker  video is displayed over the entire SLAM display, with stroke written symbology displayed over the weapon
video. The video display  format includes the following:

Weapon Video . Composite Video will be routed to displays with the video format selected. In addition to the IR
scene, missile video shall include symbology for seeker position, a good lock indication, tracking polarity
indication, FOV indication, and seeker depression indication. If the missile loses track or does not manage to lock -
on to a target, a break -lock condition will occur. The missile will then go into correlation track (video crosshair s
will retract to the edge of the display) and will remain there until either a cage/uncage or a TDC action slew. Note
also when the missile is in track  mode,  an exclusion window is placed around the target , within which the large
crosshairs and the pointing cross will not be displayed. If the pointing cross should fall within this tracking window,
then the portions of the cross that fa ll within the region will be blanked.
Pointing Cross . The seeker position will be indicated by a small pointing cross. The pointing cross position
relative to the large crosshair s will indicate the seeker position. Relative to missile boresight the tick ma rks along
the vertical crosshair  are spaced by 5 °, thereby indicating the depression angle and the scale. When the seeker
is in track and either the target is not within the launch constraint window or the tracking performance is poor,
the small pointing c ross will flash. A steady pointing cross will indicate a good lock.
TDC Assignment . This diamond -shaped symbol appears in the upper right corner of the display whenever the
TDC is assigned to the SLAM .
Field  of View . The IR video will initialize to wide FOV. While the seeker  is not in Track mode, the FOV (FOV)
options can be toggled via two methods. The FOV can be changed by selecting FOV option on the Maverick
format , or by the throttle outboard switch (HARM Sequence/FLIR FOV/ RAID).
Field -of-View  Brackets . The video display  will place four corner brackets within the wide FOV indicating what
area will be encompassed in narrow FOV. The corner brackets are not displayed in narrow FOV.
Caged/Uncaged Status . The caged/uncaged status of the  weapon is continuously provided on the video
format. when the weapon is initially selected with no existing designation, CAGED is displayed. when an uncage
signal is commanded to the missile (by depression of the uncage switch, selection of the Forced Cor relate option,
action slewing of the TDC, or by making a designation), UNCAGED is provided on the format.

 AGM-84H SLAM -ER (EXPANDED RESPONSE)
The AGM -84H SLAM -ER is a further development of the SLAM that extends the range to 150 nautical miles and
improves the missile’s terminal guidance. Employment of the SLAM -ER is nearly identical to that of the SLAM; see
the previous section for information on how to use the SLAM -ER.
The SLAM -ER will appear as “SLMR” on the Stores format. It works with the same AWW -13 Datalink Pod as the
SLAM.
Creating a SLAM -ER Turn Points (STPs)
The SLAM -ER can follow a sequence of up t o five STPs to the target. You can use this sequence to specify the
route that the SLAM -ER should follow to the target.
To specify an STP sequence, box PB11 (labeled “STP”) on the Stores format. The STP label appears when you
have boxed SLAM -ER (SLMR).

 AGM-62 WALLEYE II ER/DL WITH AWW -13
DATALINK POD
The AGM -62 Wa lleye II ER/DL (Guided Weapon Mk. 5, nicknamed “Fat Albert”) is an air -to-surface, homing glide
bomb that incorporates television guidance. It has a 2,000 -pound warhead with a maximum glide range of
approximately 40 miles.  Using HOTAS controls, the pilot can slew the seeker to have it lock on to a target with
enough visual contrast. The seeker will then self -track the target even after weapon release. Using the AN/AWW -
13 datalink pod, video from the television seeker can then be displayed on the Walleye fo rmat page. Using the
datalink, the pilot may redirect the bomb to a different target while in flight. The ER/DL in the name indicates
Extended Range / Datalink.
The Walleye is designed to attack large, static targets like buildings and bridges, and it can only be mounted on
stations 2 and 8 as singles on BRU -32/A bomb racks.
The AN/AWW -13 Advanced Datalink Pod is used to communicate with the Walleye II ER/DL. It allows for
retargeting of the weapon after it has been launched by transmitting and receiving po st-launch slew and lock -on
commands. The AN/AWW -13 provides man -in-the-loop guidance.
The AN/AWW -13 datalink pod can be held on stations 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

 When the datalink pod is selected and a Walleye is not, the top 80% of the display is static because the datalink
pod has not been linked to a Walleye seeker. Elements of the datalink only page include:
1. Data link Pod Selection Option . If a datalink pod is loaded, this option allows selection of the pod.
This is indicated as DL13 for the AN/AWW -13 pod.
2. Weapon Selection Status . An indication of  weapon selection status is provided which is like that
provided in t he Stores format. When an A/G release ready condition exists, RDY is displayed beneath
the weapon selection box.
3. Pod Antenna Option . The A ANT option selects the aft antenna of the datalink pod. It is boxed
when selected. The selection allows forward and a ft antenna control of the datalink  pod. This can be
useful when self -guiding (aft antenna) or potentially guiding for another aircraft (forward antenna).
4. Weapon Selection . The Weapon option links the datalink  pod to the selected datalink  capable
weapon. Wh en linked, the option is boxed.
5. TDC Assignment Indication . This diamond indicates that the TDC is assigned to the display. To
slew the seeker, the TDC must be assigned to the weapon video page.
6. UFC Pod Channel Selection Option . This option is used to selec t one of the two pre -set pod
datalink  channels, channel 2 if the Walleye is on station 2, or channel 8 if the Walleye is on station 8.
Pressing PB 14 displays CHNL on the top Open Select Window on the UFC. Upon colonizing the
window, the channel is entered  using the keypad and ENT is pressed. If a valid channel is entered (2
or 8), the channel  number is listed after CH on the datalink format (002 or 008).
Walleye Only Selected
When a Walleye has been selected but the datalink pod has not, the format page provides functionality to conduct
a Walleye attack without datalink. In such a situation, the Walleye can be locked to the target before launch, and
there would be no seeker video update once launched. In many ways, it behaves like an infrared -guided Maverick.
Elements of the format include:
1. Weapon Selection Status . An indication of weapon selection status is provided which is like that
provided in the Stores format. When an A/ G release ready condition exists, RDY is displayed beneath
the weapon select ion box. Otherwise, an “X” is displayed through the WEDL acronym.
2. Station Select Indication . The Walleye can be carried on stations 2 and 8. The weapon station
selected is indicted beneath the weapon selection status. Station 8 is the default priority stat ion. This
can be useful when setting up the correct datalink  channel.
3. Selected Station . Walleye 2 ER/DL is displayed as WEDL.
4. Electrical Fuzing Options . The Walleye has two mutually exclusive fuzing options, instantaneous
(INST) and delay (DLY). Pushbutton  5 is used to select instantaneous mode and pushbutton 4 is used
to select delay mode.
5. Caging Retention and Boresight (CRAB) . When the Walleye seeker has been slewed off
boresight, this option is displayed. Pressing and holding the pushbutton returns the s eeker to
boresight.
6. Station Step (STEP) Option . Pressing the STEP option toggles the selected Walleye station. If less
than two Walleye are loaded, this option is removed from the format.  [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  409

 7. Video Crosshairs . The Walleye crosshairs are a part of the weapon vi deo and are colored white.
8. Missile Axis Position (MAP) Indicator . The MAP indicator is displayed in the weapon video. Its
boresight axis is relative to the guidance head position, and therefore provides an indication of the
angle of attack when the weapon is in flight. The MAP indicator is not displayed when it is inside the
tracking gate (intersection of the crosshairs). The MAP indicator is displayed at one -half size vertically
while the guidance head position is being slewed using the datalink  (after the weapon has launched).
9. Cage/Uncage Status . The caged/uncaged status of the weapon is provided on the format. When
the weapon is initially selected, CAGED is displayed. When the cage/uncage button is pressed to
allow the seeker to be slewed, UNCA GED is displayed.
10. TDC Assignment Indication . This diamond in the top right concern of the format indicates that
the TDC is assigned to the display.

 INTEGRATED COUNTERMEASURES
CONTROL PANEL (ICMCP)

As this is Digital COMBAT Simulator, you will often find yourself as the target of enemy weapon systems. The
F/A-18C includes several defensive systems to assist you in your fight to keep alive that includes expendable
countermeasures of chaff and flares a nd Electronic Countermeasures  (ECM).
The lower console instrument group is dominated by the countermeasures dispensing system. This system
provides protection against tracking radar, air-to-air and surface -to-air missiles. Protection is provide d by ejectin g
chaff, flare, or jammer payloads (GEN -X).
The ALQ -165 Airborne Self Protection Jammer (ASPJ) is the onboard Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) system.
The ALQ -165 detects and deceives threat pulse fire control  and guidance radars and has four operating mode s:
standby, receive, transmit, and built -in test. This ECM system detects, processes, and transmits a simulated target
echo for deception when a radar signal is received. The simulated echoes are recognized by the enemy radar as
true target returns. Tracki ng radar then tracks a false target and breaks lock from the true target. Threat radar
indications are indicated as both lights and the Radar  Warning Receiver.
The ICMCP replaces  the old ALR -39 panel and moves many of the control functions to the DDI EW pa ge.

bearing to each emitter. Audio tones are produced as an advisory for emitter, or BIT status change. This will
mirror the DDI EW page.
The emitter and status display is shown on the azimuth indicator when power is applied to the ALR -67(V) system.
When an emitter is detected  and analyzed by the ALR -67 system, an alphanumeric symbol repre senting the
emitter is displayed. Certain types of emitters, when detected, are assigned unique alphanumeric symbols for
display.

The azimuth position of the displayed emitter symbol represents the relative bearing of the emitter with respect
to the nose of the aircraft. As an example, the image above shows a naval threat enhancement (boat symbol) at
40°.
The display area of the azimuth indicator is divided into four unique areas listed below:
• Critical band
• Lethal band
• Nonlethal band
Display Edge
Lethal Band
Critical Band  Non-Lethal Threat Band
System Status Circle
(With Areas I, II and III)  DCS [F/A-18C]

 • Status circle
The crit ical band is the outermost band in which specific threats or modes of lethal threats are displayed. Azimuth
tic marks are engraved in the outer most portion of the critical band. The tic marks are in 30° increments. The
lethal band is the second band in fr om the outer most portion of the display. Emitters displayed in the lethal band
are threats that have been determined to be lethal. The nonlethal band is the innermost band of the display.
Emitter symbols in the nonlethal band represent unknown and friendl y emitters. Known emitters that have been
determined to be nonlethal are also displayed in the nonlethal band.
The status circle is in the center of th e azimuth indicator and displays ALR -67(V) system status. The status circle
is divided into three areas o f display:
• Upper left quadrant of circle (area I)
• Upper right quadrant of circle (area II)
• Bottom half of circle (area III)
Area I displays the priority setting of the EW Mode as set on the EW page ( N, I, A, U, or F).
Area II is either blank when ALR -67(V)  system is operating in the full display mode or displays the character L
when operating in the display limit mode.
Area III displays current ALR -67(V) Built -In Test (BIT) status. Area III is blank when there are no ALR -67(V)
system failures. The character  B is displayed when a failure is detected. The character  T is displayed when a
thermal overload has been detected in Countermeasures Computer or Radar  Receiver.
Any time a new emitter symbol is displayed on the azimuth indicator, or an emitter symbol goes  from a less lethal
to a more lethal band, a status change tone is generated by the ALR -67(V) system. Special tones are also
generated for specific threats or critical threat modes of operation. Threats no longer transmitting or going from
a more lethal to  a less lethal band do not cause a status change tone.

 AIRBORNE SELF -PROTECTION JAMMER
(ASPJ)
The Lot 20 F/A -18C is equipped with the AN/ALQ -165 Airborn e Self -Protection Jammer, or ASPJ. The ASPJ is an
integrated electronic countermeasures system that can detect and analyzing inbound radar locks and selecting
appropriate electronic countermeasures (jamming programs) to counter the lock.
The ASPJ is a “gat e-stealing” jammer. In contrast to a noise jammer, which attempts to deny the enemy a target
lock by overloading his radar receiver with radio noise, a gate -stealing jammer lures the radar into tracking a
“cover pulse,” a false echo generated by the jammer  that is much more intense than the actual echo. Once the
enemy radar is tracking the cover pulse, the jammer can modulate the signal to walk the range or velocity gate
off the actual aircraft, then break the radar lock by ceasing its transmissions.
The AS PJ is itself capable of detecting inbound radar locks and can also use data from the AN/ALR -67 radar
warning receiver to determine when to run jamming programs.
The ASPJ mode is controlled wit h the ECM knob on the lower center console.

The mode is indicated on the EW page adjacent PB8:
ASPJ mode selecto r [F/A-18C] DCS

EAGLE DYNAMICS  423


OFF. The ASPJ is powered down. The “ASPJ” moniker will be crossed out on the EW page.
STBY.  The ASPJ powers on and completes its warmup and built -in tests (BIT). It will not transmit or receive.
The warm -up period takes approximately five minutes  to complete. When the BIT is complete, the STBY light on
the left alert panel will illuminate.
BIT: Not implemented.
REC:  The ASPJ is powered  on and will detect and alert for inbound radar locks.
XMIT: The ASPJ has consent to jam. It will automatically initiate jamming when a radar lock is detected.

When the ASPJ detects a radar lock, the REC light will illuminate on the left alert panel. If the ASPJ is in XMIT
mode, the XMIT light will also illuminate during jamming. A “JAMMER ON” indication will display on the attack
radar format during transmission .

Employing the ASPJ
The ASPJ should be powered on in STBY mode prior to entering the combat area. The warmup period takes up
to four minutes, during which BITs are run. If all BITs pass, the GO and STBY lights will illuminate. The ASP J
should be placed into REC mode when enemy radar activity is expected.
The jammer should be placed in XMIT mode as needed during engagements. Jamming creates a great deal of
radar energy, which makes it easier for enemy radars to determine the azimuth of your aircraft, while denying
them range information or a radar lock. The jammer could potentially alert enemy aircraft of your azimuth before
they would normally detect you, so it should be left off until the enemy is already aware of your presence. The
jammer can then be used deny radar lock.
At closer ranges, the jammer will be unable to generate cover pulses of sufficient intensity to mask actual radar
returns. This is called “burn -through,” and closer than this point, the jammer will be less effective a t breaking
lock. In addition, some missiles, such as the AIM -7 Sparrow and AIM -120 AMRAAM, have a home -on-jam (HOJ)
mode, where the missile switches to passive radar guidance and homes in on the radar energy from your jammer.
For these reasons, the jammer should be switched off during medium - to close -range engagements .

 HOTAS  CONTROLS
On the throttle, there is a three -place switch for countermeasures .
• Center . This is the OFF position and no dispense action is taken.
• Aft. When in BYPASS mode, this will release one flare. If not in BYPASS mode or OFF, AUTO, S/A, or
MAN mode will initiate the program.
• Forward . When in BYPASS mode, this will release one chaff bundle. If not in BYPASS mode or OFF,
it will initiate manual program 5.
