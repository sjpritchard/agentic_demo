Apply KISS, YAGNI and SOLID principles.
Use pytest for testing.
Generate complete tests for the application.
Use the Playwright tool to search for appropriate libraries and versions on https://pypi.org/.
Use uv for Python dependency management. Note that it uses pyproject.toml and not requirements.txt.
Always install the latest version of each library.
Read the uv documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ so you know how to use it.
