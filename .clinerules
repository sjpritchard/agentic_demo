Always read documentation for libraries using the Tavily search and extract tool.
Apply KISS, YAGI and SOLID principles.
Use pytest for testing.
Generate complete tests for the application.
Use the Playwright tool to search for appropriate libraries on https://pypi.org/.
Use uv for Python dependency management. Note that it uses pyproject.toml and not requirements.txt.
Read the uv documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ so you know how to use it.
